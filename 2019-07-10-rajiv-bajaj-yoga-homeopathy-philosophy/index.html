Find balance in all things in life, then stress is least just like in Yoga, when youre in a balanced position you can sustain there stress free.</p><p>Dont serve market rather create market.</p><p>Going global needs specialization</p><p>Dont sell give people a reason to buy, hence differentiation.</p><p>Homeopathy: Theres exogenous and endogenous factors, for instance his son likes to spend his vacataion time at a beach and he noticed while his son and and wife didnt get sunburnt he did, so he wondered the exogenous factor(Sun) is present for all( his wife and his son and him) but they didnt get sunburnt while he did, why was this so, or same analogy goes for Pune where Swine Flue was spreading rapidly, he proposed its not the external factors(Sun, Swine Flu) rather endogenous factors(Our Immune System) which should be paid attention to and taken care of immensely.</p><p>When in trouble narrow your focus.</p></div></div></div></div>
