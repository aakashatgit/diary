It is far wiser to just start small, crack a specific market and only then start scaling up across regions, product categories and customer segments. Also it is important to evolve with time - set new targets on achieving previous ones. For example, when I started OYO Rooms, I just wanted to have an active user base for my hotels. Today we are aiming to build OYO into the worlds largest hotel chain.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Be humble</strong>: Some of the most influential and successful Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are also the most humble people I have ever met. There is so much to do and learn that being arrogant about what you have done or have achieved will eventually create a barrier between you and new opportunities and new people who can probably help you more. Being humble is not only a virtue, but is an essential quality that everyone should possess.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Focus on your organisations culture:</strong> <!-- -->As companies scale up, the only way employees can collectively work towards achieving a common goal is to have a great culture. Teams that share a strong camaraderie and are bound together by the same vision will enable a start-up to grow and sustain. I could understand this all the more as I was mentored by someone like Peter Thiel, who has, in turn, helped shape the organisational culture at many highly successful ventures.</li></ul><p>
“It is extremely important to build something that a 100 people absolutely love using rather than make something that a 1000 people would just, <em>kind of</em>, like.”</p><ul><li><strong>Recruit only the best:</strong> <!-- -->A really important lesson I learnt was that it is very important to have the smartest people around you -- those who can be great leaders too. Bringing people on board who consider themselves to be the CEO of whatever work they do is the foundation of building a brilliant company.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Look for details and keep the big picture in sight:</strong> <!-- -->It is very important to pay attention to the micro-details. At the same time it is also important to have a birds eye view on how different parts of the business and diverse decisions interconnect towards a common vision.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Stay agile:</strong> <!-- -->Once you are committed to scaling up fast, it is very important to keep teams nimble and agile. In order to do this, we have created many micro-teams within a single team, all of which work together collaboratively to complete tasks with agility.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Set processes early on:</strong> <!-- -->Just building things fast and at the same time setting up processes which would help in building those things again much faster in the future are two completely different things. At OYO, we have invested a lot of our time in designing, building and perfecting our processes and systems. We like to call it “creating science out of art”.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Challenge the status quo:</strong> <!-- -->Companies naturally build or accumulate some kind of inertia over time. They get satisfied with the profits they are making and incremental innovations they are doing. Every once in a while, it is very important for business managers to challenge the status quo and dare to do something new. It also helps to keep the enthusiasm flowing through the company.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Work with investors you respect:</strong> <!-- -->All start-ups require capital to seed, run or scale. While it is critically important to find and secure the necessary capital to run your organisation, it is absolutely vital to bring on board those investors who you admire, trust and would like to work with. This creates a great foundation for any start-up and has been a major factor for OYOs success thus far.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Gun for a great product:</strong> <!-- -->Last but not the least, here is one lesson from my fellowship that I cant emphasise enough. It is extremely important to build something that a <!-- -->1<!-- -->0<!-- -->0 <!-- -->people absolutely love using rather than make something that a <!-- -->1<!-- -->0<!-- -->0<!-- -->0 <!-- -->people would just, <em>kind of</em>, like.</li></ul></div></div></div></div>
