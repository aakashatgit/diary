The harder you work, the harder it is to surrender. It never gets easier, you just go faster. If everythings under control youre going too slow. The only way around is through. Nothing happens unless first we dream.</p><p>When i look at something i dont see what it is, i see what it could be. The key to bearing torture is not think about pain but about what that pain protects.</p><p>Fight or flight reponse, choose.</p></div></div></div></div>
