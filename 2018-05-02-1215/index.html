Simply relied on easy coaching, which too wasnt done diligently.</p><p>Didnt have a routine-schedule to follow.</p><p>Sleep schedule messed, wake up early.</p><p>Dhoni like strategising, Kohli like hardwork. Kohli or Dhoni dont win on the day of match rather on days before when they refused to sleep back or refuse to rest or get accustomed to comfort or leisure. Its like the iceberg, top is what we see but the bottom part(strategy,planning, practice, execution) is where everything lies.</p><p>Longterm goal alignment with what you have right now, look at bigger picture(Even if not able to get into Big four dont take it on your pride) think about what “can” be done for growing towards longterm goal(MBA or CA Rank, etc).</p><p>Daily goal review(Longterm-Midterm-Shortterm)</p></div></div></div></div>
