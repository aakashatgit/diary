I didnt fap all through exams(<!-- -->7 <!-- -->days) and it was awesome to never be distracted and kill time over searching for porn and then feeling tired while all the hormones(Melatonin) try to make me sleep while i have work left to do.</li><li>Why do we fall? To pick ourselves up, nothing more truthful than this in harsh times. Law exam didnt go well but kept myself in one piece and simply focussed on the next thing in hand i.e. Cost-FM exam and performed well in it as per after exam analysis.</li><li>Never ever allow yourself to be overconfident, after accounts exam pretty well and i had <!-- -->2<!-- -->.<!-- -->5 <!-- -->days for Law preparation, i wasted <!-- -->1 <!-- -->whole day with chit-chatting when Aastha came or relaxed myself from the efforts that could have been put in and that was reflected while writing exam, i couldve done multiple revisions and couldve remembered a lot more than i had. Overconfidence and a sense of relaxation when i had to be alert, focused and shouldve dedicated my will-power towards the hardwork required proved to be one of the lessons learnt that day.</li><li>Never ever give up, when something doesnt go as planned never ever lose hope. Remember the compounding graph, push yourself, its dark before dawn. After being let down by Law paper had i given up hope and sat back while not preparing diligently for next exam(Cost-FM) i would have regretted upon missing the opportunity. But that didnt happen and things went well in Cost-FM exam.</li><li>Always do the questions that youre <!-- -->1<!-- -->0<!-- -->0<!-- -->% sure about, even if you dont know one of its part but the other <!-- -->3 <!-- -->go for it. This way youre sure of fetching <!-- -->7<!-- -->5<!-- -->% marks in that question atleast. Theory questions in Cost-FM are the gold mine.</li><li>When learning or studying new things it is essential to grasp the concept wholeheartedly such that you can explain it to a <!-- -->5 <!-- -->year old. The more vivid clarity you have the better you will be at exams when questions are twisted. In general as well always try to get to the root of the concept and understand it better, so you know the workings as well. For instance instead of rote learning the annuity formulas learn how were they derived, so that in case you forget them you are capable to derive them then and there.</li><li>Risk And Return playoffs in Real Life In IPCC Cost-FM Nov<!-- -->1<!-- -->7 <!-- -->exam if i had calculated risk-return tradeoff i would have picked up both theory questions because upon analysis i wouldve known that risk was less and return was sure short, however i didnt do it and attempted practical questions which have high risk but same return. Had i picked up the theory question i couldve lost <!-- -->4<!-- -->M x<!-- -->1<!-- -->Q but <!-- -->4<!-- -->Mx<!-- -->3<!-- -->Q wouldve been sure short. Just because i saw this <!-- -->1 <!-- -->part that i didnt know i decided instantly to let go of that question. These biases will always be there in real life, how do you get around them, how do you deal with them? Apply “follow up” questions, as Ray Dalio does. He often questions himself, “How do i know i am right on this?” and this counters the Anchor Bias. It stops us right there and question our proposed action, now we should apply our logical and analytical tools like Risk-Return tradeoffs, Oppurtunity Cost, etc. Be it real life instances like stock market or in personal finance, a choice between PPF or any other alternative, there always a “choice” and most efficient way to deal with choice is to use risk-return analysis. What would i get and what would i lose. So just before acting upon, stop and analyze options at hand. Better to sharpen axe for <!-- -->6 <!-- -->hrs than to chop tree with an un-edged axe for <!-- -->2<!-- -->4<!-- -->hrs.</li></ul></div></div></div></div>
