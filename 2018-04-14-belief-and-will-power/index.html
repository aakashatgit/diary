I went for the first time after the last instance with Bajaj and Ibtisam.</p><p>But i knew “I had to do it”, I “believed” in it. I knew the “why”. I believed in myself. I had will power that no matter what happens i will go through this and “i will complete and achieve the goal of running 5 laps non-stop”.</p><p>Even during early days, when i used to skate, same philosophy and mindset was followed by myself. Goals or targets that seemed impossible or very difficult were achieved because i “strongly believed in myself- i knew it had to be done, theres no other way out of it for me”. I knew i had to go through it and achieve it because i wanted to defeat myself and prove to myself that i can do it. Will power ensued as i started going through the journey.</p></div></div></div></div>
