Im terrified by pigeons, their spontaneous air lifts especially. But seeing him stuck, helpless i was convinced that i had to get rid of my fear and help him.</p><p>Interestingly just 5 seconds of insane courage helped me get over my fear. Once i gently touched him, reluctant to do so but i forced my self, talking to myself- “You can do it” and it happened.</p><p>Amazing how we can influence our actions just my talking to our self, inducing self belief in ourselves.</p><p>I tried to lift him but a lot of times failed, he would simply explode to fly out and i would freak out dropping him back to square one.</p><p>But I didnt give up, i tried and tried and tried, took me over an hour but finally i did. I rescued a pigeon!</p><p>It was phenomenal, i felt i had done something great today. I felt fulfilled and interestingly i could now focus more on my work(studies-IPCC), i had a sense of responsibility over me now, a pressure to keep the positive energy going on. Maybe by helping others or doing self-fulfilling tasks we get more responsible, more attentive to issues at hand with induced belief that we can get over them, achieve our goals.</p><p>The pigeon stuck signified people living their lives stuck in the vicious cycle of payments-earnings, financial captivity.</p><p>People stuck in lives just like the pigeon, with their problems, missing opportunities, unable to create new ones. And at this moment all they require is 5 seconds of insane courage, it really works like charm, and they can turn their lives around swiftly.</p><p>A pigeon taught me a lot- to never back down, handle stress situations calmly, exhibit insane courage sometimes, illusions that get you stuck- daydreaming, hoping loved ones will revive back, etc.</p></div></div></div></div>
