How he went to the Pension Fund CEO, which at first he missed his meeting but went on to his house to “create” oppurtunity and not let go and quit, throwing it off on his destiny-luck-fortune. From there although he got rejected for the deal he was trying to make with CEO but he made a lot of “valuable” contacts which later on helped him fetch commissions and expand his business during internship with several of them in the end before end of his internship. How he got arrested the night before his interview for internship and then went straight back for it in inappropriate clothes without taking even a bath with paint stains all over his face and how he moulded that situation in fis favor by making a joke about pants upon being asked.</p><p>Hardwork How he worked day-night, reading the Security Analysis book when he had no “proper education”, just a high school passout with no “satisfactory” work experience. How he let go of his comforts, even sleep for nights that too dealing and being in such intense situations with no guaranteed shelter alongwith his kid, broke when IRS freezed his accounts. How he slept in bathrooms of metro stations or how he studied in the street light entering through window of a homeless shelter while his kid got minimal sleep or while his son was eating in restaurant. How he used to save time by not drinking water or continuously making calls because he had to leave early to pick up his kid while also doing better than everyone else(fighting them) to bag a job offer after internship.</p><p>Perseverance, Dealing with Disappointment How he was underrated- underappreciated, early ins school he used to get As in History and thought he would make something good of himself and then it didnt go as he had thought. When he had no money for Taxi ride back and he ran without paying and almost made it into metro train except for the machine. When his wife left him and took his child alongwith her knowing the fact being a good father and being there for him meant the most as he met his father when he was 28. How things got straighten out after moving into the motel and were getting good and when he was able to sell all of the machines but then one morning everything was taken away by IRS</p><p>Makes His Way Through On His Own, Not Depenedent on Destiny or Others Takes an initiative on his own to differentiate himself from others, to get that extra oppurtunity. Waited for Resource Head, Jake to submit his application “personally” to show/highlight himself. Went to Pension Fund CEOs house after missing the meeting and went to game alongwith him after successfully creating an oppurtunity with him, which further created oppurtunities in the form of valuable contacts he had gathered there by meeting CEOs friends and colleagues.</p><p>Him and his Wife are exact opposite personalities, while he never gives up, remains strong, takes up adversity with will power and make it through attitude alongwith hardwork, his wife is complete opposite, over-reacting, quitting before even starting or along the way and not working hard, result oriented.</p><p>How his wife questioned his abilities upon being told that hes due for an interview for the internship and how she rubbed it on his face that he is not capable for it, there is no point doing it instead he should try to sell machine that day.</p><p>Fight When he was almost broke and had to seek night shelter but then he found the one but it was only for women and children instead of losing out there he fought with the lady, argued and tried to convince her and she then directed her to one where they could spend the night. Upon reaching there and going through the long line his place was taken by another man as he skillfully broke the line and placed himself in front of him as he was the last one to get admitted to shelter so he fought with him there itself, no shame no hesitation. When had no shelter(all places got filled) and no money(paid $5 to Taxi of his boss, left with almost nothing) went out to donate blood to earn money, somehow found a night shelter, his son tells him hes a good father while he was tucking him in, while he slept he studied under the street light coming through the window whole night and fixed the broken machine he recovered from the crazy homeless person who stole it. Finally was able to sell it.</p><p>Completed the exam second(first person had left out the essay at back) and aced it.</p><p>Doesnt magnify pain or pleasure, has a “it happened no big deal Ill deal with it” attitude, not sensitive to them, doesnt increase its intensity by constantly focussing on it or keep thinking about it rather works and does whats needed to deal with it. Kind of stoic, basically doesnt let external things and stimulatef emotions to affect him, contains them, doesnt let them grow. Not sensitive to them.</p></div></div></div></div>
