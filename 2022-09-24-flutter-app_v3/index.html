Max Verstappen
Michael Jordan- “Why should i think about missing shot until i havent taken one”; used to live in present; extreme competitiveness/hard-work/focussed; used to take losses personal; Pain is my motivation</p><p>Remembering what you’ve been through and how that has strengthened your mindset can lift you out of a negative brain loop and help you bypass those weak, one-second impulses to give in so you can power through obstacles. </p><p>Someone who has an edge: “I look for the type of guy in London who gets up at seven oclock on Sunday morning when his kids are still in bed, and logs onto a poker site so that he can pick off the U.S. drunks coming home on Saturday night. I hired a guy like that. He usually clears 5 or 10 grand every Sunday morning before breakfast taking out the drunks playing poker because theyre not very good at it, but their confidence has gone up a lot.” - Michael Platt, Bluecrest</p><p>Don’t partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling</p><p>Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.</p><p>Imagine someone comes along who demonstrably has slightly better judgment. They’re right 85 percent of the time instead of 75 percent. You will pay them $50 million, $100 million, $200 million, whatever it takes, because 10 percent better judgment steering a $100 billion ship is very valuable. </p><p>There are basically three really big decisions you make in your early life: “where you live, who you’re with, and what you do.”</p><p>Duality and polarity: “If I say I’m happy, that means I was sad at some point. Every positive thought even has a seed of a negative thought within it and vice versa, which is why a lot of greatness in life comes out of suffering. You have to view the negative before you can aspire to and appreciate the positive.”</p><p>Ive missed more than 9000 shots in my career. Ive lost almost 300 games. 26 times, Ive been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. Ive failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.</p><p>I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I cant accept not trying.</p><p>You must expect great things of yourself before you can do them.</p><p>Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, and others make it happen.</p><p>To be successful you have to be selfish, or else you never achieve. And once you get to your highest level, then you have to be unselfish. Stay reachable. Stay in touch. Dont isolate.</p><p>If you quit ONCE it becomes a habit.Never quit!!!</p><p>Never say never, because limits, like fears, are often just an illusion.</p><p>Always turn a negative situation into a positive situation.</p><p>To learn to succeed, you must first learn to fail.</p><p>If you do the work you get rewarded. There are no shortcuts in life.</p><p>The minute you get away from fundamentals – whether its proper technique, work ethic or mental preparation – the bottom can fall out of your game, your schoolwork, your job, whatever you’re doing.</p><p>Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.</p><p>Failure is acceptable. but not trying is a whole different ball park.</p><p>I approach everything step by step. I had always set short-term goals. As I look back, each one of the steps or successes led to the next one. When I got cut from the varsity team as a sophomore in high school, I learned something. I knew I never wanted to feel that bad again. So I set a goal of becoming a starter on the varsity. That’s what I focused on all summer. When I worked on my game, that’s what I thought about. When it happened, I set another goal, a reasonable, manageable goal that I could realistically achieve if I worked hard enough. I guess I approached it with the end in mind. I knew exactly where I wanted to go, and I focused on getting there. As I reached those goals, they built on one another. I gained a little confidence every time I came through. I f your goal is to become a doctor a nd you’re getting Cs in biology then the first thing you have to do is get Bs in biology and then As. You have to perfect the first step and then move on to chemistry or physics. Take those small steps. Otherwise you’re opening yourself up to all kinds of frustration. Where would your confidence come from if the only measure of success was becoming a doctor? If you tried as hard as you could and didn’t become a doctor, would that mean your whole life was a failure? Of course not. All those steps are like pieces of a puzzle. They all come together to form a picture. Not everyone is going to be the greatest.But you can still be considered a success. Step by step, I cant see any other way of accomplishing anything.</p><p>overthinking -&gt; write

If you do all those things, you are almost certain to succeed. If you don’t, you’re going to need a lot of luck. </p><p>The great lesson of life is get them the hell out of your life—and do it fast, Munger said of people who are a bad influence. But that’s not all: He advises people to also be prudent with money and always be open to learning throughout their lives.</p><p>you are what your deep, driving desire is; As your desire is, so is your will. As your will is, so is your deed. As your deed is, so is your destiny</p></div></div></div></div>
