Never feel disheartened when you lose some opportunity, everything happens for a reason. Back in the fall of my 10th standard, after being state champion consecutively for 3 times and then bagging 2 golds, 1 silver, 1 bronze, I was  a New Kid In Town. But soon on returning back I decided to quit it. Back then I felt I gave away an opportunity with my bare hands. I would question myself at times not believing why I had taken such a decision, am I losing something big? You see I was and am an extremely competitive person. Being skeptical about my decision was very fearing, but this decision was directly from my soul, no ones interference was present and I stood about it. And now I feel it was one of the best decisions I had taken for grabbing better opportunities. I had to derail my lifes path in order to build a new one. As they say in order to build something new you gotta destroy it first. And “Kahin pahonchne ke liye kahain se nikal na bahot zaroori hai”</p><p>So whatever you decide, dont decide under any external interference. And if its within you just believe in yourself.</p></div></div></div></div>
