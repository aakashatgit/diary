Earlier the shower pressure wouldnt be high therefore very limited pressured water in limited quantity used to pour down.</p><p>However this time since i switched it off and after applying soap upon turning it back i experimented upon the knob and it turned out that the problem all this time was with the knob for slow pressure and not the shower system or geyser.</p><p>By doing something out of comfort zone, challenging myself not only i was bale to fulfill myself but also able to create knew opportunities.</p></div></div></div></div>
