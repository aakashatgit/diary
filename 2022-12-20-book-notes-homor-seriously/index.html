-  comedians rant about things that inspire irrational anger
    - “I hate parties. But then to have to go to an after party? Are you kidding me?!?”), college basketball (“Is there no vaccine for March Madness yet?!”), and birthday cards (“What do I do with old birthday cards? Keep them? Throw them away? They’re useless. No more cards please. Email me.”)
- When tapping into your anger in your own jokes, be sure to temper your temper. Directing a rant directly at a target will hurt feelings and won’t feel funny. But if you’re able to take those feelings and direct them at an amusing, fictionalized cartoon version of whatever it is that annoys you, other people may be able to feel how you feel without feeling personally attacked.</p><h2 id="notice-what-you-think">Notice what you think</h2><ul><li>Think about things that make you say I will never understand why <strong>_<!-- -->_</strong>_<!-- -->_ <!-- -->is the norm.</li></ul><h2 id="pain">Pain</h2><ul><li>plenty of pain becomes funny only after a certain amount of time has passed.
