However grim these givens may seem, they contain the seeds of wisdom and redemption.”</li></ol><ol><li>Freedom not only requires us to bear responsibility for our life choices but also posits that change requires an act of will. I see willing as having two stages: “a person initiates through wishing and then enacts through deciding.”</li></ol><p>Some people are wish-blocked, knowing neither what they feel nor what they want. Without opinions, without impulses, without inclinations, they become parasites on the desires of others. Such people tend to be tiresome. Other patients cannot decide. Though they know exactly what they want and what they must do, they cannot act and, instead, pace tormentedly before the door of decision. “Things fade: “alternatives exclude.” Of the first postulate, death, I have already spoken. The second, “alternatives exclude,” is an important key to understanding why decision is difficult. Decision invariably involves renunciation: for every yes there must be a no, each decision eliminating or killing other options (the root of the word decide means “slay,” as in homicide or suicide). ”</p><ol><li>I do not like to work with patients who are in love. Perhaps it is because of envy—I, too, crave enchantment. Perhaps it is because love and psychotherapy are fundamentally incompatible. The good therapist fights darkness and seeks illumination, while romantic love is sustained by mystery and crumbles upon inspection. I hate to be love’s executioner.</li></ol><ol><li>“He had so much caring, so much loving. I’ve had other therapists who tried to be warm, to put you at ease, but Matthew was different. He really cared, he really accepted me. No matter what I did, what horrid things I thought, I knew he’d accept it and still—what’s the word?—confirm me—no, validate me. He helped me in the way therapists usually do, but he did a lot more.”</li></ol><p>“For example?”
“He introduced me to the spiritual, religious dimension of life. He taught me to care for all living things. He taught me to think about the reasons I was put here on earth. But he didn’t have his head in the clouds. He was right in there with me.” “I loved the way he tangled with me. He didn’t let me get away with anything. He always called me on my shitty habits.”</p><ol><li>So far it was apparent that Thelma’s love for Matthew was, in reality, something else—perhaps an escape, a shield against aging and isolation. There was little of Matthew in it, nor—if love is a caring, giving, need-free relationship—much love.</li></ol></div></div></div></div>
