Erik taught   the earlier you open the stronger your hand needs to be, also, he tells hyper aggressive players go broke in LT, even though in short term they could boon</p><p>Erik says 
    be solid fundamentally
    cultivate solid image
    then add hyper aggression (at right place/ time)</p><p>Ofcourse being hyper aggressive all the time might give ST boon but eventually will lead to demise, also, being too passive/ conservative and you become too predictable Thing you have to conquer most obviously is yourself Mike Tyson said it best  &gt; everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face also means   until you experience everything that can go wrong you won’t know if you have what it takes, in other words, you never learn how to play good poker if you keep on getting lucky</p><p>this doesn’t imply permission to fail but rather something fundamental that we often forget about when we’re learning something new or just going about our lives   * you need a way of testing your thought process *   am i thinking correctly</p><p>It makes sense that learning to lose in a game   to lose constructively and productively and come back and not see it as a personal failure</p><p>Erik
    When he started he had nothing and nearly lost it all
    dropped out of college to play backgammon, then decided to go to wall street around 1987 crash, lost jbn and wife pregnant
    didn’t take loss personally, re evaluated options and went into studying
    lack of eon and objectivivty </p><p>Rudyard Kipling   If you can meet with triumph and disastre, and treat those 2 imposters just the same</p><p>Erik   * less certainty, more inquiry * eggs white only earlier, stayed open minded when new info came, leveraged objectivity, started eating yokn and white part</p><p>Action proceeds motivation   you wake up after getting out of bed and not before</p><p>What’s more, in an age of omnipresent distraction, poker reminds us just how critical close observation and presence are to achievement and success
How important it is to immerse yourself and to learn new things, truly As Erik told me that first day, lesson one: pay attention</p><p>And what if the bet is even higher? Suddenly, we have a corrective for many of the follies of human reason “If we imagine to ourselves that we have to stake the happiness of our whole life on the truth of any proposition, our judgment drops its air of triumph, we take the alarm, and discover the actual strength of our belief,” says Kant Would you bet your entire net worth on an opinion that you’ve just spent hours confidently offering on social media, broaching no possibility of being mistaken? Would you bet your marriage? Your health? Even our deep convictions suddenly seem a lot less certain when put in that light</p><p>Poker is such a powerful window into probabilistic thinking not in spite of, but because of, the betting involved: the betting in poker isn’t incidental It’s integral to the learning process Our minds learn when we have a stake, a real stake, in the outcome of our learning It’s why kids learn so much better—and remember what they’ve learned—if they know exactly how or when they’ll apply the knowledge This is the partner element to learning probabilities from experience: not only do we understand what 29 percent feels like; we now retain that knowledge because if we don’t learn, it hurts us If we keep betting the wrong amount, we will be punished If we keep saying “I think I’m good here” without quantifying how often we’re actually good, we’ll lose all our money</p><p>It’s a difficult lesson to internalize outside the poker table Even people who seem like they suffer consequences, like stock traders, are often loath to admit that they were wrong in their certainties Because the world is much messier than the poker table, it’s far easier to blame something else It’s easy to have an illusion of skill when you’re not immediately called out on it through feedback Poker rids you of the habit in a way nothing else quite does—and in so doing, it improves decisions far afield from the game itself</p><p>Erik has explained that the earlier you open, the stronger your hand needs to be, because more players are still to act</p><p>So what’s the answer? Action Dan and Erik himself actually offer a pretty compelling case study by their success: Be solid, fundamentally Cultivate the solid image And then add the hyper aggression, but at the right place and the right time Not always, not continuously, but thinkingly</p><p>The thing is, the circumstances are usually not right—and the hyper aggressive player may run over everyone for a while and forget that at some point, it will all come to a screeching halt Of course, being too conservative is also a liability You become predictable And often times, you lose the ability to press the fold button You’ve been waiting so patiently for a good hand that you won’t let it go </p><p>“But here’s what I can tell you The thing you have to conquer most obviously is yourself,” Dan continues “Mike Tyson said it best ‘Everyone has a plan until you get punched in the mouth’ And he’s right Until you go through a month of everything going wrong, you won’t know whether you have what it takes You will never learn how to play good poker if you get lucky—it’s as simple as that You just won’t”  He’s not talking about hazing It’s not the attitude of “no pain, no gain” Nor is he giving me “permission to fail” Instead, he’s talking about something very different, something so fundamental that we often forget about it whether we’re learning something new or just going about our lives: you need a way of testing your thought process </p><p>Before I get fancy with strategy, with the curlicues and trappings of expertise, I need to answer something far more basic: Am I thinking correctly? Before I start experimenting with writing free verse, have I learned how to think through a poem’s basic structure? Before I start adding those exotic spices to my recipe, have I learned how to make a basic white rice? And the only way to do that is by failing By writing bad poetry Burning your food Turning in shitty first draft after shitty first draft “You have to suffer defeat,” Dan continues “As brutal as it sounds, that’s the way it is”</p><p>What’s crucial, Dan says, is to develop my critical thinking and self assessment ability well enough that I can constantly reevaluate, objectively, where I am—and whether where I am is good enough to play as I’m playing It’s not about winning or losing—that’s chance It’s about thinking—the process Dan himself is a living illustration of how true this is: he quit not during a downswing but at the top of his game “Nine years ago, I’d just won $163 million I’m walking out of the tournament, and I look around, I say, ‘This is it I can’t take this crap anymore I win $163 million and all I do is feel tired and beaten down This is just not worth it’ I just right then and there decided I wasn’t going to play serious poker anymore My heart’s not in it” Most people won’t tell you to quit after the biggest score of your life But Dan could tell that he was getting weaker, he was getting older, and the field was getting stronger He’d quit before he had fallen behind</p><p>“You become a big winner when you lose,” Dan says “Everyone plays well when they’re winning But can you control yourself and play well when you’re losing? And not by being too conservative, but trying to still be objective as to what your chances are in the hand If you can do that, then you’ve conquered the game”</p><p>“DAN IS GREAT,” ERIK agrees And, yes, everything he has told me is true: one of the keys to success, Erik says, if not the key, is objectivity And objectivity is a hard thing to come by “It’s good that you’re starting with a rare realistic understanding of what you’re up against,” he says “You know that these swings happen, that there’s a randomness to the way these swings happen”  So he went to Wall Street—just in time for the crash of 1987 He lost his job And Ruah was now pregnant He didn’t take the loss personally Instead, he reevaluated his options and buckled down on his studying He was, in essence, “scared into playing well” And he started winning Why did he emerge on the other side while so many others didn’t? Obviously, there’s the talent factor—Erik is clearly someone who is very good at the component parts of poker—but there’s a larger skill at play: his absolute lack of ego His willingness to be objective about himself and his own level of play</p><p>“When things go wrong, other people see it as unfairness that’s always surrounding them,” he tells me They take it personally They don’t know how to lose, how to learn from losing They look for something or someone to blame They don’t step back to analyze their own decisions, their own play, where they may have gone wrong themselves “It’s a really big handicap in life to think that way All of us can step into that sometimes, but it’s important to know the difference It’s like that great Kipling quote: ‘If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster, and treat those two impostors just the same’”</p><p>Langer asked each participant a series of questions: Did they feel they could improve on this task? Did they feel they were particularly talented at it? Did they need more time to get better? Would they be better with limited distraction? And so on In each case, the obvious answer is no: to answer otherwise is to classify something that is the outcome of chance (a coin toss) as being in the realm of skill But the obvious answer is not the answer she got When students had a random progression or one where the accuracy clustered near the end, they did indeed answer in the negative But when the correct answers were clustered up front, they developed a sudden myopia Why yes, they said, they are quite good at this, and yes, they would improve with time Success led to an abject failure of objectivity: suddenly, they were in the throes of the illusion of control They thought that they could actually predict the results of a coin toss</p></div></div></div></div>
