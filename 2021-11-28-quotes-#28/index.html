Jamie is smart. He doesnt have as much cash to work with since he bought Bear. Lloyds a superstar. Goldmans the smartest shop on the block. And just because I used to be his boss, it doesnt mean hes gonna listen to me. John Mack used to run around the floor screaming, “theres blood in the water<!-- -->! <!-- -->Lets go kill someone<!-- -->!<!-- -->″ Hes a fighter. Thain was my number two at Goldman. Hes selfish. Hes a pragmatist. He knows-- if Lehman goes, Merrills next. Vikram Pandit is the new guy at Citigroup. No one knows if hes running Citi or if Citis running him.</li><li>Kohli: “i try but woh agr khatm hogaya In the last <!-- -->1<!-- -->0 <!-- -->years have you ever woken up not feeling <!-- -->1<!-- -->5<!-- -->0<!-- -->% passionate cause I believe you wake up feeling <!-- -->1<!-- -->5<!-- -->0<!-- -->% passionate every day when you go to play. - Everyone has off days. - Ive woken up feeling a sense of detachment from what Im doing. Thinking that I dont want to do this. But that has been because of excessive pressure thats been on me during a difficult phase. But still, Ive had the ability to still tell myself no. I’ll go out and try once morehe day you lose the will to go out and try once more then you can’t do anything and No one can convince youo chance. So what is the motivation? Motivation is just about winning. The day I lose my passion, I’ll stop playing.”</li><li>My mother used to say, “It’s the exception that proves the rule.” She meant, for example, the fact that only a tiny number of people can do something proves that most people can’t.</li><li>Things may to come to those who wait but only the things left by people who hustle.</li><li>If awareness shapes the outer boundary of what is possible in the life of a person, then the ability to operate effec</li></ul><p>tively within such a boundary determines the probability that they will. The reason that this relates to agency is that, ultimately, your awareness is what determines your beliefs and establishes the boundaries of what you perceive to be possible. This in turn directly impacts the daily decisions you make about what to do with yourself. If you read any biography of a prominent person, there will almost undoubtedly be a mention of an event or an instance that completely changed how they approached their lives. Sometimes, it’s a brush with mortality, but other times, it’s something as simple as realizing that maybe the rules they had always assumed to be facts weren’t actually set in stone. We all have these pivots of awareness that shift our perspective about what is real and what is important and what is worth doing. We can’t intellectualize them beforehand because they require first-hand exposure through experience. They expand agency by redefining possibility.

If you do all those things, you are almost certain to succeed. If you don’t, you’re going to need a lot of luck.”</li><li>“You should write your obituary and then try to figure out how to live up to it,” Buffett said in response. “It’s not that complicated.”</li><li>“The great lesson of life is get them the hell out of your life—and do it fast,” Munger said of people who are a bad influence. But that’s not all: He advises people to also be prudent with money and always be open to learning throughout their lives.</li></ul></div></div></div></div>
