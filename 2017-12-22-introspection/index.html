But you have a blockade about CFA, the problem is that you arent the “first one” to start it rather its him but dont forget you did know about it infact you were the one to point it out to him at the park, maybe he did know but you too had in mind as well when Jiju pointed it out in 1st year and you had downloaded the prospectus also, remember? But you had deferred it post college because there was this 3rd year condition and you had IPCC to go through first, right? So it isnt that you missed it, get it?</p><p>And moreover dont compare yourself with anyone, just do what you want/need to do, as Harvey says, “Kill them with success and Bury them with a smile.”</p><p>Now start focusing on your goals, CA IPCC and Big 4 articleship and in between CFA L1, L2.</p><p>You need to have a laser focus on them.</p><p>Meanwhile reflect on your mistakes why couldnt you plan for May18 CFA L1 attempt? Because you fucked up in IPCC G-1 in 2016(because of slackness, lack of planning and doing)  and even during 2017 summers you could have interned somewhere or instead of wasting  tremendous time from Dec16 to Jul17 on developing things which at present couldnt be even shipped. You wasted 9 months(Goa, Development, Whatsapp, etc.) where you could have prepared for CFA L-1 alongside or maybe interned somewhere. But you didnt, instead you were in your comfort zone all the time. Why is that? Because you had no goals in your mind hence you didnt focus.</p><p>You have to stick to your goals and achieve them first and then, if times left, do other stuff. Focus. Prioritize. Do.</p><p>Be serious and aware about things youre doing and how performing them could lead you to your end goal. What is your end goal? To build something great and leave a legacy behind. What do you want to build? Something that impacts the lives of substantial amount of people. How will your formal education(CA,CFA,MBA) help you get their? Open up my mind, will tell me about how things work in world, provide me with security so that i can freely pursue things, get me a voice- reputed one, open up various opportunities- how can i be sure of what i want when i havent “tried”(you cannot discover and try everything) to discover it all.</p></div></div></div></div>
