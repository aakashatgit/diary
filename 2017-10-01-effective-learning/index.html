Whether it is brushing up your football skills or learning how to ride a bike, our brains, in order to learn, need to “do it” as if we have learned it, to thicken the myelin on axons. This is how our brain learns something new.</p><p>In case of studying for exams, we need to practice for the exam scenario for more efficiency and effectiveness i.e practice by hand, write!. Simply dont read and “recollect”. By writing it down you are effectively “doing” what is to be done on that day. This way you retain more. Also by revising more often, the very night, then 2 days hence, after 7 days from initial introduction and henceforth we are able to store this piece of information “permanently”, i guess myelin coating would be very thick in such cases.</p><p>Often we consume so much information these days that its very hard to recall when its needed. This is mainly because that very piece of info, be it the economic scenario of some country or some stock news lying in your mind and our mind is unable to retrieve it, infact we may completely forget its even there, we even forget that we had read it earlier. Thats why, as Elon Musk does, we need to create a tree of information, just like a family tree.</p><p>By connecting various pieces of information we can easily sort, filter and retrieve them. A better way for learning stuff since most knowledge we consume is waste of time if we cannot apply it or even retrieve it rather forget after x days. By arranging and managing the chaos of information we not only can retrieve info in time but also differentiate and connect different pieces of info in creative ways for more innovative viewpoints and ideas. And thats what the point of gaining knowledge is, to be able to conclude something new by crisscrossing various nodes of data.</p></div></div></div></div>
