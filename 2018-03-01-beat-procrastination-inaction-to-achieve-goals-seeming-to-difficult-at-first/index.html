Instead what worked was “taking a small step towards the goal” - turn on shower so as to get whatever water running, “to get into the flow, get the flow running”, and as soon water started puring down, in minuscule quantum the flow started and consequently <em>i was able to wash my hands first and then able to throttle up the shower easily.</em> And then was able to wash up myself completely and easily.</p><p>Scenario which seemed difficult at first(turning up shower at full throttle), after getting the flow running(turning up shower even in bits) i.e taking a small step at it, getting the flow started, eventually helped me achieve the difficult task at hand.</p><p>Getting “started” instead of staring down upon problem with inaction helps to get going and on the way we can figure out what seemed impossible or difficult at first, instead of completely withdrawing ourselves from taking any action altogether and letting go of it by quitting out of it or abandoning it.</p></div></div></div></div>
