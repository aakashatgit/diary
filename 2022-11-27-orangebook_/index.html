If you truly care about someone, call them today, meet up, listen with a kind ear, share some laughs. One day, you will wake up, and they will be gone.</p><p>Most people only want the truth when it?s formulated in a way that doesn?t make them feel bad about their life decisions.</p><p>Mentally strong people aren?t people who never struggled.  They are people who kept re-building themselves more solidly every time they broke.</p><p>Its funny when wealthy people come up with a bunch of pseudo-intellectual reasons explaining the secrets of their happiness and well-being. Truth is, its much simpler to be happy and healthy when you dont have to worry about money.</p><p>You feel stupid when you are surrounded by smarter people, but you also start questioning your own intelligence when you are only surrounded by people who don?t make any sense.</p><p>Smart kids grow anxious when they are stuck with bad teachers, and know they could learn much faster their own way.</p><p>As you invest more efficiently in yourself, as you grow physically and mentally stronger, you understand that you can stand up alone, you understand that you can handle anything life throws at you, and your anxiety slowly fades away.</p><p>There is a lot of angry people online because there is a lot of lonely, unloving, unloved people offline.</p><p>Smart people keep their opinions to themselves when its about things they dont understand.</p><p>People think they want money. They actually want to drop the fake smiles. They want to stop pretending to be who they are not. They want to speak their mind fearlessly.</p><p>You cant change the mind of someone who prefers the comfort of lies.</p><p>Its easy to feel lost and get depressed when your life is too comfortable.  Your mind wants to be challenged with difficult goals. The rewards are peace of mind and a meaningful life.</p><p>People who do a lot of self-reflection often assume that everyone else is doing the same. There is a reason why most people never change.</p><p>Most people don?t understand their own desires, they just want what other people want, and they never ask themselves why.</p><p>If you are tired of overthinking everything you say because someone might get offended, just hang out with smarter people.</p><p>In retrospect, the best moments of your life are very simple. You had time to enjoy intimate moments with your family and friends. You had time to devote yourself to reading, learning, creating. You had time to appreciate life without constantly chasing money and achievements.</p><p>The smarter you get, the less you fit in, but the more likely you figure out how to happily live the life you want.</p><p>True wealth is simple: you are healthy, you have time for yourself and for people you love, you feel confident and at peace.</p><p>People treat you well when they need you. Their true character is revealed when you can do nothing for them.</p><p>Most people dislike you when you can clearly see through them.  Authentic people appreciate you instead.  They wont have to waste time playing mind games.</p><p>You are always wrong when you assume people arent going to be greedy and foolish.</p><p>You suddenly become mentally stronger once you understand that acting like a victim doesn?t improve your life, and that you are alone.</p><p>As you get older, you realize that life is indeed short.  You try new things, some succeed, some fail. Don?t waste time blaming yourself for what you could have done better. Cut your losses, and don?t look back.</p><p>Never trust those who keep insisting on how altruistic, selfless, good people they are.</p><p>The best course of action when you feel angry is often to do nothing and wait it out. You can?t be smart unless you are calm.</p><p>There is no point being the fastest if you don?t finish the race.</p><p>Never underestimate your own ability to ruin what you have. Life loves to strike when you start growing overconfident.</p><p>You didn?t choose your birth circumstances, but every day, you are choosing where you will be in ten years.</p><p>No one cares about how ?weird? you are once you are successful enough.  They will call you ?interesting? instead.</p><p>Don?t be so quick to jump to conclusions and judge others, everyone is figuring things out as they go, just like you.</p><p>When you grow up poor, you spend your time thinking about how to help your parents, then one day, you notice you helped yourself in the process.</p><p>Most people act like you dont exist unless they want something from you. People who genuinely care about you and your story are very rare.</p><p>You are not responsible for the emotional education of the other adults.</p><p>A great day is simple: 1) a full night of sleep to feel clear-minded and focused 2) a tough workout session to feel positive and optimistic 3) a long walk to feel connected with nature and your own thoughts 4) a deep conversation with someone inspiring to feel more ambitious</p><p>Once you experience serious health issues, its easy to stop obsessing over the rat race of where you are supposed to be at your age.</p><p>Its addictive to be around smart people. They dont feel entitled. They know what they want. They are financially responsible. They dont constantly get offended. No constant drama or misunderstanding. They dont waste your time.</p><p>Any positive change you make will be widely criticized, because many people  benefit from things not changing.</p><p>It?s not painful to try and fail. It?s painful to spend your whole life wondering what could have happened if you just had a bit more courage at that time.</p><p>Kind people are people who suffered from others, then chose to not be like them.</p><p>Physical exercise is mental therapy.</p><p>Life rapidly gets better once you expect less from others and more from yourself.</p><p>The perfect conditions to focus don?t exist. Money, family, health: you will always have something else in the corner of your mind. Just do what you can with what you have.</p><p>You were already very lucky if you grew up with parents who believed in you.</p><p>If you missed a life-changing opportunity, just get ready for the next one. It?s coming faster than you think.</p><p>Loneliness doesn?t come from being alone. It comes from being around people who make you feel you are never good enough.</p><p>You grow mentally weak when your life is too comfortable.</p><p>Just be yourself is widely misinterpreted. It doesnt mean stay the way you are. It means become the best version of yourself.</p><p>Life is more fragile than most people think. One day, you are laughing with them.  The following day, they are gone. Don?t waste your time with quarrels. Stop obsessing over being right. You have less time together than you think.</p><p>In the end, you won?t care much about how rich, popular, strong you once were. You will care about whether you had a meaningful journey with the people you love.</p><p>You are not humble just because you talk yourself down. You are not smart just because you overthink everything. You are not a good person just because you let people take advantage of you.</p><p>Idolizing someone, no matter how talented they are, won?t improve your life.  Respect them, learn from them, but make sure you are focused on your life.</p><p>You grow faster once you stop lying to yourself about whether you love the current version of yourself.</p><p>If you wait until you have time, it will never happen. When you truly care about something or someone, you make time for them.</p><p>Difficult books make you smarter. Difficult circumstances make you wiser. Difficult problems make you more creative.</p><p>Don?t apologize for thinking differently. Don?t apologize for keeping high standards. Don?t apologize for prioritizing family over work. Don?t apologize for asking legitimate questions.</p><p>There will always be more work, there will always be more opportunities, but people you love will not always be around.  Don?t forget your priorities.</p><p>People who easily get offended live in a fantasy world, because no one around them bothers telling them the truth anymore.</p><p>Hang out with self-confident people who have no reason to envy you, you will avoid a lot of drama.</p><p>There are times when you work harder than others, and nothing works out. There are times when you are just having fun, and everything works out. Dont expect a steady, predictable journey.</p><p>You are not an adult just because your body got bigger and older.  You become an adult when your mind is serene and emotionally mature.</p><p>People love to play the victim card when they get caught trying to take advantage of others.</p><p>People who are insecure about themselves love to seek flaws in others.</p><p>There are plenty of smart, positive, kind people out there. Be selective with who you spend your time with. That?s self-respect.</p><p>Stop assuming you have time, or the years will pass, and nothing will improve.</p><p>Everyone is a fast learner once they start something they truly care about.</p><p>You will struggle to focus until you give yourself a clear deadline.</p><p>You meet a lot of people, then you realize what you needed was to treat better the few people who truly matter. You make a lot of money, then you realize what you needed was more free time to do what you truly love. Don?t seek more, seek meaningful.</p><p>You will always feel like there is too much to do and not enough time.  You dont need to do everything.  You need to focus on what matters.</p><p>The difference of talent is often just a difference of how people spend their free time.</p><p>Just stay healthy and fit, you will naturally outcompete most people in terms of mental clarity.</p><p>Stop trying to do everything at once. Focus, then be patient.</p><p>The best things in life happen suddenly, but only after years of struggles in the right direction.</p><p>You are not a good person just because you choose to suffer more.</p><p>Ask yourself when you?re going to reach your goals at this pace, and if you don?t like the answer, change your process.</p><p>If it won?t matter a few years from now, do yourself a favor, stop worrying about it.</p><p>Many smart people fail to live the happy life they could live just because they constantly overthink, and never have the courage to act.</p><p>You get things done once you stop obsessing over perfection.</p><p>A clear goal, a clear vision of how to get there, a clear deadline, and suddenly life keeps getting better.</p><p>Strengthen your body to calm your mind. Calm your mind to heal your body.</p><p>Mentally healthy people don?t spend their time arguing with strangers online.</p><p>Life is never boring when you enjoy taking risks.</p><p>Creative work is a cure to the overthinking mind.</p><p>People often forget why they wanted money. It wasnt about living an extravagant lifestyle. It wasnt about attracting fake friends. It wasnt about acting self-important. It was about the freedom to pursue what they love. It was about peace of mind, and a fuller life.</p><p>You worry less as you get smarter, because you understand how it?s just a waste of time.</p><p>Focus on being able to provide for your family. Execute your long-term vision with humility and diligence. You will naturally attract wealth.</p><p>If hard work was enough, hard-working people would all be wealthy. If kindness was enough, kind people would all be loved. If intelligence was enough, smart people would all be happy.</p><p>Be kind, not naive. Be honest, not hurtful. Be bold, not disrespectful. Be focused, not obsessed. Be thoughtful, not anxious. Be detached, not indifferent.</p><p>To grow faster is to make better mistakes.</p><p>Challenging yourself every day isn?t about personal growth, it?s about mental health.</p><p>In doubt, choose a difficult goal that requires you to grow. You either succeed, or you grow, there is no failure.</p><p>You don?t need motivation, you need gratitude. Once you understand how much you?ve received from the world, you naturally want to give back.</p><p>Never take good health for granted. Today was already a gift if you had no health issue.</p><p>The secret of a better life is to mind your own business and focus on your goals.</p><p>You are not happier when you have everything you wanted.  You are happier when you are in the process of getting what you want, and things are going well.</p><p>Everyone is a critic until they find a meaningful purpose and focus on their own creation.</p><p>Life only gets harder when you make up excuses to lower your standards. Life only gets better when you find reasons to strive for a better version of yourself.</p><p>You dont find yourself. You choose who you become, day after day, through self-discipline and hard work.</p><p>The first thing you should buy with money is time to self-reflect and figure out what kind of life you want to live.</p><p>Your wealth follows your mental health. Happy people attract opportunities.</p><p>The best gift for your future self is to invest in your physical and mental health. The second best gift for your future self is to invest in your financial freedom. The third best gift for your future self is to build a loving family. They are the foundations of a happy life.</p><p>You don?t need to be particularly smart. You only need to consistently avoid being stupid over the course of your lifetime.</p><p>Life gets better once you stop thinking you are special. Don?t waste years just because you don?t have enough humility to learn from older people. Many have been where you currently are.</p><p>Life is a game where all the winners are long-term thinkers.</p><p>When you live in your mind, you think the whole world is constantly judging you.  People actually don?t care about you at all. Decades will pass, you will die, you will soon be forgotten. Stop worrying so much, start enjoying all the experiences life has to offer.</p><p>You were very lucky if you grew up around your grandparents and benefited from their wisdom.</p><p>The smartest moves often lie in what you choose to not do.</p><p>Everyone suddenly wants to invest in you and be your friend after you already succeeded.</p><p>Sometimes, old friends are unable to see you for who you are, because they are blinded by the old version of you that still lives in their mind.</p><p>Self-confidence comes from overcoming difficulty. A tough workout session, a risky bet that pays off, an uncomfortable conversation that was needed. You never feel more satisfied than after you push yourself despite being scared.</p><p>Reaching your goal doesn?t make you happier, the process of reaching your goal is where peace of mind lies.</p><p>You are not defined by your mistakes. You are defined by how you choose to bounce back.</p><p>Don?t try to change others, change yourself until you become someone who inspires change.</p><p>You don?t know who your real friends are until life puts you in a situation you cannot escape alone.</p><p>Hang out with people who fill you up with ambitions, not people who drain all your energy.</p><p>You can?t teach someone else how to be happy. It?s a personal choice, and the work is internal.</p><p>When you learn a foreign language, you understand your mother tongue better. When you live abroad, you understand your home country better. When you get older, you understand your parents better.</p><p>You are wrong to lower your standards because people around you feel uncomfortable. Seek people who won?t stop you from expressing the best version of yourself.</p><p>Many people waste years waiting for someone to come and save them.  Smart people quickly understand that no one is coming, and start helping themselves.</p><p>Anxiety is there to remind you that you aren?t who you want to be. Anger is there to remind you that you aren?t happy with your current life. Envy is there to remind you that you are distracted by others. Focus on yourself, build wealth, become a better version of yourself.</p><p>Mind-changing books are uncomfortable. Wealth-changing bets are uncomfortable. Life-changing decisions are uncomfortable. Change is always uncomfortable.</p><p>Hang out with emotionally stable people, you will suddenly avoid a lot of drama.</p><p>The best revenge is to learn, move on, live a happy life.</p><p>Fast learners are simply people who are genuinely interested in what they are doing.</p><p>Signs of maturity: 1) You no longer complain about how life is unfair 2) You understand that no one cares about you unless you bring value to the table 3) You stay calm when things dont go according to plan 4) You fix your own problems 5) You stay focused on your life</p><p>?Figuring out what you want to do? is a lifelong process. Keep defining new goals, keep renewing yourself, there is no finish line.</p><p>You don?t feel drained because you are working hard, you feel drained because you don?t enjoy what you are doing.</p><p>Reading is only useful if you have enough experience to think critically. Failing is only useful if you did your best to not fail. Discussing is only useful if you are ready to change your mind. Working hard is only useful if you are in the right direction.</p><p>You are where the younger version of yourself took you. You are also responsible for where the older version of yourself will be ten years from now. Every day, you choose your destiny.</p><p>People smart enough to understand what life they could live, but not smart enough to actually live it, often end up bitter and cynical.</p><p>At various stages of your life, you start thinking that this time, you have things figured out, then you are proved wrong once again. Stay humble, or life will humble you.</p><p>If your plan is to wait for someone to come and save you, you need a better plan. No one is coming. Your life is your responsibility.</p><p>Life-changing opportunities keep coming as long as you keep investing in yourself.</p><p>You always feel like you don?t have enough time. You actually don?t have enough concentration.</p><p>There are nearly 8 billion people out there.  They don?t know you exist, and they don?t care. You matter less than you think.  Stop worrying about making mistakes, jump before you are consumed by regrets.</p><p>Help yourself, stop obsessing over things that happened years ago, you should be moving on instead.</p><p>You will lose health. You will lose money. You will lose family and friends. You will lose sight of your goals. Don?t ask why it happens. That?s just part of life. Invest in a more resilient mind. Know you can always rebuild. You can overcome anything life throws at you.</p><p>You don?t get happier as you upgrade your lifestyle, you get happier as you upgrade your mind.</p><p>Learn to react less, leave your ego aside, all your relationships will suddenly improve.</p><p>You are most attractive when you simply enjoy your life.</p><p>You feel lonely when you don?t give yourself enough attention.</p><p>You don?t need expensive tutors to learn. You don?t need a fancy gym to work out. You don?t need to be ready to get a job. You don?t need a reason to be kind. You don?t need alcohol to have fun. You don?t need to be rich to invest. You don?t need motivation to start.</p><p>A healthy relationship involves two people who were already happy alone.</p><p>The more you try to control someone, the more you are pushing them away. Deep down, everyone wants freedom.</p><p>?Home? is where you feel accepted. ?Family? is where you feel loved. ?Purpose? is where you feel at peace.</p><p>Your growth stops the day you identify as a victim.</p><p>Align your daily actions with your core beliefs if you want peace of mind.  Anxiety will otherwise remind you that you can?t lie to yourself.</p><p>It?s never too late to update your beliefs, renew your habits, become someone you will enjoy the company more.</p><p>Take the time to understand thoroughly. Connect the dots at your own pace. Rushing only brings confusion. Learning in depth brings clarity.</p><p>Assemble the following 1) An ambitious long-term plan 2) A circle of trusted family and friends 3) The courage to make mistakes 4) The maturity to not blame others 5) The humility to improve yourself 6) The wisdom to react less often 7) The readiness to be a beginner again</p><p>People underestimate how quickly good health can go away. Don?t take any day for granted.</p><p>Your biggest enemy is the version of yourself that wants to settle for comfort.</p><p>Use your money to learn faster. Use your money to build a healthier lifestyle. Use your money to help people you care about. The most meaningful things money can buy are quite simple.</p><p>You want to become a clearer thinker, you need to spend more time alone with your own thoughts, and keep writing every day.</p><p>Intelligence is also about not wasting your time worrying about things that won?t matter in the long run.</p><p>People struggle to grasp that: - true friends are rare - their parents did their best - lack of clarity is lack of honesty - lack of growth is lack of courage - living abroad resets their identity - gut health impacts mental health - money is for buying time to truly live</p><p>Money doesn?t buy talent, love, happiness, but it certainly buys time to work on all of the above.</p><p>Reading what you wrote a few years ago is a great way to notice how much personal growth you achieved.</p><p>Dont focus on the goal. Focus on becoming the kind of person that can achieve the goal.</p><p>Anxiety won?t disappear until you become a version of yourself that shows self-respect.</p><p>If you became 1% better than yesterday, it was a productive day.</p><p>You would have made it already if you werent obsessing over shortcuts, and just decided to play the long-term game.</p><p>It?s a great conversation if it triggers ideas you didn?t know you had in you.</p><p>You get luckier and attract more opportunities once you genuinely enjoy your own company. Your vibes are your future.</p><p>Kids are forced to sit down for six hours a day listening to something they might barely care about, then are diagnosed ?hyperactive? or with an ?attention deficit disorder? when they refuse to comply. Let them explore what they love. You?ll see they have no problem to focus.</p><p>Your brain will reorganize itself, and you will naturally think more clearly, if you give yourself more idle time. You are not more productive just because you are busy all the time.</p><p>Keep your private life as it should be, private.</p><p>You grow faster once you become honest with yourself and admit that you are not who you want to be.</p><p>You are always wrong to expect others to understand your vision. Start building it first. People can?t read your mind, they can only see results.</p><p>Life gets more fun once your goals are more ambitious. Don?t shy away from bigger dreams, life is much more interesting when you keep surprising yourself.</p><p>Any meaningful goal takes more time than you think. Setbacks are more frequent than you expect. Life happens much faster than you imagine. Know what you want, then don?t waste time.</p><p>Your career is not meant to be straightforward. There will be moments when you question whether you love what you do. You will experiment with new things that might lead you to a whole new life. You will unlearn and relearn all your skills as the world changes. Stay flexible.</p><p>Anxiety is also when you feel like everyone is making progress in their lives, and you are not. The solution is to spend more time working on your goals rather than just watching the others working on theirs.</p><p>It?s normal to regularly feel stupid when you are working on difficult goals.</p><p>There are tons of people struggling financially who don?t cheat, steal, beg for money, deceive and scam others. Don?t blame society for who you chose to be.</p><p>A great day: 1) You woke up without an alarm after a full night of sleep 2) You had meaningful work, that allowed you to learn and be helpful to others 3) You took the time to appreciate that you are alive 4) You had some good laugh and spent quality time with people you love</p><p>Productivity boils down to: 1) You have a clear vision of who you want to be and what you want to do 2) You don?t mind a decade of steady work, because you enjoy what you do 3) You assume you don?t have much time left</p><p>People who love themselves naturally spread love around them. Take good care of yourself first. It?s not selfish. It?s the best thing you can do for people around you.</p><p>You are not going to be a great scientist or artist in one year You are not going to reach a native level in a foreign language in one year You are not going to build a loving family in one year So much time is wasted on trying to find shortcuts Good things simply take time</p><p>You can?t blame anyone else for the mismanagement of your own life.</p><p>If you never spend any time alone, you can?t think independently, you can?t learn with real depth, you can?t reorganize your own thoughts, you can?t understand what you truly want from life. Time alone isn?t lonely, it?s mind-fixing, it?s life-changing.</p><p>Hang out with people who can discuss uncomfortable issues without getting all emotional, in a respectful way.</p><p>Life can go wrong faster than you think. Never take anything for granted. Its so easy to lose sight of what truly matters.</p><p>Just waking up healthy is already a privilege that too many people, caught up in life, no longer know how to appreciate.</p><p>Don?t treat others with disrespect just because you?re having a tough day.</p><p>It?s more mentally draining to be purposeless than to be challenged every day by difficult goals.</p><p>They are happy because they are living the life they want, not because they talk about happiness all day long.</p><p>Surround yourself with people who push you to be more ambitious, not people who are scared of living.</p><p>Everyone thinks they understand the world until they travel more. Everyone thinks they understand themselves until they write more. Everyone thinks they understand what they want until they actually get it.</p><p>Society suddenly makes sense once you understand there are no adults,  only older kids playing games of money and power, and who started to take themselves way too seriously.</p><p>Money doesn?t change you, it reveals who you secretly wanted to be.</p><p>You end up average when you are distracted by everything and can?t commit to anything.</p><p>Difficult books make you smarter. Difficult problems make you more creative. Difficult drills make you more confident. Difficult circumstances make you wiser. Difficult goals make you move forward.</p><p>Everything life throws at you is an opportunity to level up.</p><p>If you are smart, you will make it either way, if you are not, you will screw up either way, so relax, there is nothing to worry about.</p><p>People only want to hear about your struggles if they led to a happy ending.</p><p>Self-respect leads to better habits. Better habits lead to better focus. Better focus leads to better life. Just respect yourself.</p><p>Take care of your health when you are already healthy. Start investing when you are already financially secure. Find a better job when you already have a job. Build meaningful relationships when you are already happy. The best time to start is when you don?t need to do it.</p><p>You can never fully speak the truth if your words are connected to your income.</p><p>Never assume you know better just because you are older. In the world of today, people who can?t unlearn fast are burdened by their own experience.</p><p>Don?t spend your whole life broadening your options, sooner or later, you have to know what you want and commit to something.</p><p>You will naturally genuinely wish the best for other people once you are happily living the life you want.</p><p>If you are wealthy, many people want to believe you were already born in a wealthy family. If you are smart, talented, good-looking, loved, they want to believe it all came with no effort. People love to make assumptions about you that make them feel better about themselves.</p><p>Don?t use the Internet to get angry, jealous, anxious. Use it to learn, gain financial freedom, connect with interesting people, live a better life.</p><p>Be prepared for the worst-case scenario, but spend all your energy towards making the best-case scenario your reality.</p><p>Kids don?t hate school. They hate the lack of freedom. They hate to be forced to memorize things they don?t care about. They want to be able to choose a learning method that suits them better. They want to be able to invest more time in what they are actually good at.</p><p>People high in energy simply have a clear purpose and a meaningful reason to wake up every morning.</p><p>Everyone is a fast learner when they study something they really care about.</p><p>You invest in yourself first, then people line up to invest in you once you are talented enough.</p><p>You are not a better person just because you choose to suffer more.</p><p>Envy disappears once you have the intelligence to understand that your energy is better spent elsewhere.</p><p>If you have a clear vision of who you want to be, what kind of life you want to live, and what kind of sacrifices you will have to make, you are already halfway there.</p><p>Financial freedom can also mean that you are free from thinking about money, because you have none left.</p><p>Competing against yourself every day is mental therapy.</p><p>Humbling people who think they are too smart to fail is a feature of life.</p><p>The calmer version of yourself is locked behind years of deeper self-reflection. The more talented version of yourself is locked behind years of tougher training. The wealthier version of yourself is locked behind years of smarter investments. Good change takes time.</p><p>Self-confident people are just people who kept the promises they made with themselves ten years ago.</p><p>You don?t struggle to focus when you do something you truly love.</p><p>Of course, you could have done better.  You can always do better.  Don?t waste your energy getting frustrated.  Learn from your mistake, then move on.</p><p>To grow is to keep challenging yourself with work you weren?t qualified to do when you started.</p><p>The end goals of money are freedom and peace of mind, but people often forget about it, and they just start obsessing over numbers instead.</p><p>Failing in public will expose all the people who secretly disliked you. Some people only show up when they can kick a man when he?s down.</p><p>Paying back your debt to the person who helped you when no one believed in you is one of the best feelings.</p><p>Buying assets is easy, investing well is hard. Marrying is easy, building a happy family is hard. Working hard is easy, working hard in the right direction is hard. Taking risks is easy, owning your decisions is hard. Starting habits is easy, keeping them for decades is hard.</p><p>Anxiety is when you think too much and don?t act enough.</p><p>Twitter reminds you that even smart people are constantly wrong when they are outside their area of expertise.</p><p>A lot of drama is avoided once people stop assuming they know whats best for others.</p><p>If you love teaching, you will naturally keep learning just for the pleasure of conveying your knowledge.</p><p>Making mistakes isn?t scary, living your whole life anxious because you know you aren?t growing, that?s much scarier.</p><p>Your doctor should be healthy. Your fitness trainer should be fit. Your language teacher should be polyglot. Your financial advisor should be wealthy. Your mentor should be happy. Raise your standards. Be more selective. Learn from people who embody what they teach.</p><p>Don?t settle for a version of yourself you don?t like.</p><p>Everyone can achieve much more than they think, but it always takes much more time than they would like.</p><p>Anxiety is the gap between your full potential and your current reality.</p><p>Assume your best years are yet to come, invest with a long-term mindset, and opportunities will keep rolling in.</p><p>The more you write, the more flaws you notice in your thinking.</p><p>Hang out with people high in energy, they bring luck into your life.</p><p>Many people dont know what they want to do because they havent invested enough in themselves.

You keep training and refining yourself, then you naturally understand.</p><p>Trying to be ?normal? will give you anxiety if your potential lies in your differences.</p><p>It?s painful to end a relationship with an older version of yourself, but that?s the price of growth.</p><p>Life becomes more fun once you play the long-term game of investing in yourself.</p><p>There is a solution for each problem. Just remember you are not a victim, but a problem solver.</p><p>Money may not buy happiness, but very often, unhappiness comes from financial worries.</p><p>The whole world isn?t judging you, the whole world is busy with their own lives and doesn?t care about you.</p><p>All your other assets become insignificant when you lose your health.</p><p>You suddenly feel energized when someone you care about needs your help.</p><p>The best time to take more risks is when you can afford to fail.</p><p>You don?t need motivation, you need a more meaningful reason to work hard.</p><p>People invest in you after your investments in yourself already paid off.</p><p>One day, you?re going to wake up as usual, and someone you love will be gone.  Never take anyone for granted, appreciate the time you have together, make sure you sincerely express how you feel.</p><p>Hang out with people who encourage you to take bolder risks, not people who shoot down all your tentatives.</p><p>You thought it was too late, you still started, you stuck to it for ten years, then you realized it was never too late.</p><p>Living abroad will teach you so much about your home country.</p><p>Relax, you don?t need to catch up to others, just enjoy catching up to who you could be.</p><p>Don?t mistake an expensive lifestyle for a happy life.</p><p>Life doesn?t reward efforts, it rewards efforts in the right direction.</p><p>You can?t compete against people who genuinely enjoy learning unless you enjoy it yourself.</p><p>Anxiety disappears after you truly become who you want to be.</p><p>It?s a long road.

No one owes you anything.</p><p>Too much comfort numbs the mind.</p><p>Everyone is so smart when it comes to judging others, but they somehow always have a good excuse when it comes to their own lives.</p><p>Aim to renew yourself every few years or so. The new version should always be smarter, calmer, happier.</p><p>It takes more time than you think, don?t be too hard with yourself. Put in daily work, focus on the long-term vision, don?t forget to enjoy yourself.</p><p>The best way to compete against others is to focus on your own growth.</p><p>No one is going to fund your hobbies, you want more creative freedom, get more financial freedom.</p><p>No one cares about your potential if you never deliver.</p><p>Spend less time convincing people who cant see your vision, and more time building the future with those who do.</p><p>Solving difficult problems is another form of therapy.

Own who you currently are, then get better.</p><p>Everyone is so smart when it comes to telling others how they should live their lives.</p><p>The clarity of your goal is the intensity of your focus. Understand why you do what you do, you will find all the energy you need.</p><p>Many times, people just want to feel listened and understood, not lectured, not judged. You don?t have to always give your opinion.</p><p>A walk, and your mind gains clarity. A family, and your mind gains purpose. A workout, and your mind gains confidence. A meaningful work, and your mind gains focus. A deep conversation, and your mind gains ambition.</p><p>Don?t blame, just get smarter, wiser, better.</p><p>You are never too busy for people you truly care about.</p><p>It?s not about money, it?s about being able to relax and do what you love.</p><p>Never assume you know what?s best for others when you barely know what?s best for yourself.</p><p>You can appreciate what you already have and still be ambitious about what you could have.</p><p>You have a long way to go if you think you deserve special treatment just because you had a tough life.

You will understand that the problem wasnt lack of time, but lack of focus. Deeper concentration, better results.</p><p>You lack self-confidence when you are always waiting for someone to tell you what to do. Take initiatives, make mistakes, question yourself, do better, feel better.</p><p>Too much comfort will sedate your mind. Focus comes from a place of discomfort.</p><p>If you have no connections, build them. If you have no money, work, save, invest. If you have no friend, be a better person. If you have no talent, practice more. If you have no idea, walk more. If you have no confidence, commit more. If you have no clarity, write more.</p><p>You suddenly do what needs to be done once you realize you are alone.</p><p>Banks lend you more money when you are already rich. You are most attractive when you are already happily married. People help you more when you no longer need help. Wealth attracts wealth.

A calm mind is a smart mind.</p><p>Life gets quieter as you get wealthier.</p><p>You don?t stop growing when you reach a certain age, you stop growing when you choose to settle.</p><p>Being scared of everything is a symptom of being addicted to comfort.</p><p>Hang out with emotionally mature people, they don?t get offended all the time, you can disagree and still calmly discuss, less drama, you save a lot of time.</p><p>Easy to feel depressed when you?ve been too comfortable for too long.

Have a long-term coherent vision, calmly execute every day.</p><p>Never underestimate how much something can change in a few months: you, people, the world.</p><p>You want trust, get results. You want results, get self-discipline. You want self-discipline, respect yourself.</p><p>You want people to read what you are writing, keep it short, keep it clear, because everyone is busy.</p><p>A bad job leaves you intellectually and financially poor. A great job builds up self-confidence, skills, connections, and the desire to pursue your own dreams.</p><p>There is no point reminding someone about how they used to be ten years ago, they grew up and moved on, you should too.</p><p>Don?t go around messing with other people?s lives just because you had an unhappy childhood and don?t feel loved.</p><p>They attack you when you just wanted to mind your own business, then act like they are the victim when you fight back.</p><p>Most relationships come and go, but two people who truly want to stay connected always find their way back to each other.</p><p>How you age is more of a lifestyle choice than just genetics.</p><p>Give them a bit of comfort and entertainment, most people suddenly forget about their dreams and ambitions.</p><p>Some people make you dream after each conversation, some people drain away all your ambitions, choose wisely.</p><p>Maturity starts when you stop blaming your childhood for the decisions you are making today.</p><p>In doubt, ask yourself what the best version of yourself would do.</p><p>You get luckier the day you take responsibility. You get smarter the day you become honest with yourself. You get loved the day you start loving others. You get wealthier the day you start thinking and executing long-term. You get happier the day you appreciate what you have.</p><p>It?s okay to admit that you don?t know or don?t understand what?s going on.</p><p>Hang out with people who take risks and challenge themselves, you learn so much every time you meet up.</p><p>A deep conversation with a trusted friend often reignites the ambitions you forgot you had.</p><p>Don?t be ashamed of your mistakes.

Be one: renew yourself, stay driven, chase ambitious goals, you will naturally attract your kind.</p><p>Stop trying to ?fix? people, focus on becoming a better person, then lead the way.</p><p>Getting things done is self-respect.</p><p>You easily waste years when you keep thinking you still have time.</p><p>You become a faster learner once you understand why you do what you do.</p><p>Don?t take yourself so seriously, you will cringe in a few years after you get more mature.</p><p>Being angry and overreactive all the time isn?t how you improve your life. Calmly thinking up a long-term plan and executing, that?s how you do it.</p><p>Don?t be rude with others just because you?re unhappy with your life.</p><p>Learn until you are confident in your ability to learn anything, that?s when the real game of life begins.</p><p>Don?t go around telling people about all your future plans. Get things done first.</p><p>Just hang out with smarter people, less drama, less anger, better life.</p><p>It?s not about hard work, it?s about feeling at peace with yourself, knowing that you gave it your all.</p><p>You dont need perfection. You need progress.</p><p>There is nothing more attractive than a clear mind who knows what they want.</p><p>Too much money, not enough purpose: you get depressed, start buying things you don?t need.

Success is when you are who you want to be.</p><p>Starting is the easy part, the difficulty is to keep going when you don?t feel like it. Good things take time, commitment, and sacrifices.</p><p>Relationships are suddenly less complicated when they involve people who are financially responsible, emotionally mature, and who know what they want.</p><p>Life suddenly gets better once you stop waiting for someone else to fix your problems for you.</p><p>Wealth is also the freedom to learn what you love at your own pace.</p><p>You want to become more productive, just stop assuming you still have time.</p><p>The hard things become enjoyable when you stick around long enough.</p><p>Everyone wants to be your friend once you have proven yourself capable.</p><p>Smart people don?t play the victim, they are busy finding solutions, they are busy making their lives better.</p><p>The secret is to do what needs to be done whether you feel like doing it or not.</p><p>You naturally relax once you realize most people never think about you at all.</p><p>Stop seeing yourself as a victim, life is gifting you challenges, they are your opportunity to grow, take a hint, and bounce back stronger.</p><p>Don?t blame lack of talent when it?s lack of discipline.</p><p>You often have to temporarily do things you don?t enjoy to build the life you will enjoy. Everything has a price, just pay.</p><p>Raise your standards, focus on your goals, mind your own business, and life will keep getting better and better.</p><p>It?s difficult to be creative if you are constantly busy. Give your mind time to relax.</p><p>A deep conversation with a trusted friend will refresh your mind and clarify your goals.</p><p>Stop worrying about the opinion of people who obviously already chose to dislike you.</p><p>Stop overthinking what you can or cannot do, simply do your best, and let reality be the judge.</p><p>You usually feel more relaxed after you challenged yourself and worked hard.</p><p>You wake up full of energy every day when your goals are clear.</p><p>The more you relax, the smarter you get.  Go for a walk, journal, lift, sleep well, spend time with people you love: your mind will naturally get clearer.</p><p>Mental weakness leaves the body when you train hard enough.</p><p>First, you work hard because you want freedom, then you work hard because you enjoy it.</p><p>The clearer the deadline,  the sharper the focus.</p><p>You become much more talented once you stop believing in talent and start believing in self-discipline.</p><p>Hang out with people who respect your need for time alone.</p><p>A happy person in a relationship with an unhappy person: two unhappy people. A smart person in a relationship with a fool: two fools. A driven person in a relationship with a lazy person: two lazy people. Choose your spouse wisely. You can?t change people.</p><p>Confused minds make everything sound complicated. Clear minds make everything sound simple.</p><p>Crowds are often wrong, remember to step back and reevaluate your position whenever you are part of one.</p><p>Too many people lost their common sense. They make zero effort to eat, exercise, rest well. Zero effort to sustain meaningful, loving relationships. They only think and act short-term. Don?t expect some miracle pill for your mental health. The cure is in your daily actions.</p><p>Stop trying to ?fix? others, fix yourself, then lead the way.</p><p>Compound interest works both ways. After years of sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy food, you can?t expect a few months of training and healthy diet to revert the damage you caused to yourself. Own your mistakes, understand who you want to become in five years, start pushing.</p><p>You want a home, not just a house. You want freedom, not just money. You want peace of mind, not just silence. You want purpose, not just being busy.</p><p>As you get smarter, you stop jumping to conclusions, because you understand how completely wrong you often are.</p><p>Avoiding drama is simple. Just hang out with smarter people.</p><p>People spend too much time worrying about finding the right person, and not enough time becoming the right person.</p><p>Sometimes, the only thing left to do is to have a good laugh at the absurdity of the situation, then move on and start over.</p><p>You suddenly attract more opportunities once you are more cheerful and optimistic.

Instead of wasting your time making up excuses, invest in yourself and do better.</p><p>A sign of success: you don?t envy younger people, you even help them get where you are.</p><p>Most people start with no money. Just get rid of your pride, get a job you might not like, save money, be eager to learn, invest with conviction, think in decades, be patient.

They actually struggle because they don?t sufficiently compete with the best version of themselves.</p><p>When you meet someone you want to keep in your life, you will know it. Conversations will flow, time together will be effortless.</p><p>When your purpose is clear, you wake up excited, you spend the day focused, you go to bed happy and satisfied.</p><p>Once in a while, start learning a new foreign language, you will remember what it was like to be a beginner, you will be humbled.</p><p>Most people don?t lack intelligence, they lack courage.</p><p>You want to learn faster, put yourself in a situation where you?re gonna have to in order to survive. That?s why you grow so much when you live abroad.</p><p>Overthinking won?t help, learn to know when enough is enough, learn to jump when it feels right.</p><p>You will never catch any opportunity if you keep waiting until you feel fully ready. Jump when you are still scared.</p><p>Until you have a meaningful purpose that makes you wake up every day excited, keep searching.</p><p>Everyone can grow much more than they think they can, the secret is to be able to handle time alone in a productive way.</p><p>Great relationships don?t distract you from becoming the best version of yourself, quite the opposite.</p><p>The happier you are in your private life, the less you want to show it off in public.</p><p>Read books that make you feel stupid, you will get smarter.</p><p>A common mistake of young people: not being bolder, when they have little to lose.</p><p>Stop blaming other people for the decisions you?ve made. You are responsible for the life you have. You chose where you are today, ten years ago.</p><p>You can solve a lot of problems by being less impulsive and by not reacting.</p><p>It?s rare to genuinely wish the best for someone else unless you are already happy yourself. Help yourself first.</p><p>If you are still lucky to have your parents or grandparents,  never take them for granted, get to know them better whilst you still can. You have less time together than you think.</p><p>People with no goal and no ambition consistently invent drama. Hang out with ambitious people who know what they want.</p><p>Avoid people who choose to cry, blame, complain, instead of fixing their problems.</p><p>Your relationships are supposed to improve your life, not make it worse.</p><p>The standards are getting lower and lower, you just need to focus on your life and respect yourself to outcompete the vast majority.</p><p>You don?t look at the clock when you are doing what you love.</p><p>You will cross paths with tons of people. It doesnt always work out as you wanted. Dont wish ill on people who moved onto a different path. Let go of people who left earlier than you hoped. Appreciate people who chose to be in your life. Thats it. Thats life.</p><p>Intelligence is about understanding the world you live in, and how you can leverage your strengths in order to live the life you want.</p><p>You dont lack talent, you lack self-discipline.</p><p>When you crave deep, meaningful conversations, remember that introverts often have the most to share.</p><p>Traveling with friends is fun. Traveling with family is meaningful.

You want a better life, just invest your time more intelligently.</p><p>Dont waste time with someone who makes zero effort to become a better person.</p><p>People often make foolish choices when they feel lonely. Learn how to be happy alone, your life will sort itself out.</p><p>People can smell it when you are desperate for something, and it?s never attractive.

Living is not enough, we must pay attention.</p><p>Whats the problem with failing? As long as you are alive, just try again.</p><p>Success is more about courage and grit than wits and knowledge. Many smart people fail precisely because they overthink.</p><p>Working out also shapes the mind.</p><p>Sign of an educated mind: you have learned to let go of the past and dont let it affect your present happiness.</p><p>Reminder: be kind, but not stupid.</p><p>If you don?t want to do a ?meaningless job,?  but you don?t want to put in extra efforts to become talented at valued, scarce skills either, it?s time to grow up.</p><p>If you want a reason to get offended,  you will find one. If you want a reason to be grateful,  you will find one. Either way, you decide.</p><p>Regardless of the discipline, the most successful people are all long-term thinkers who consistently execute short-term.</p><p>When you are a kid, you think older people have things figured out,  then you become part of the older people, and you understand.</p><p>If you struggle to learn self-discipline, start hitting the gym consistently. It will help all the other areas of your life as well.</p><p>The number one reason why people miss opportunities: being scared of asking.</p><p>Dont seek respect from others. Seek self-respect.</p><p>Time to read, write, self-reflect, take a walk, exchange ideas with independent thinkers, accumulate practical experience all around the world. On your own terms, following your own values, at your own pace. Thats real education.</p><p>When you pretend to understand what you don?t, you only fool yourself.</p><p>Notice how people who have time to notice and comment others? mistakes are never successful.</p><p>A sign of intelligence: Being able to unlearn your conditioning. Most people will never even notice it.</p><p>You don?t have time to feel envy when you?re busy building the life you want.</p><p>I don?t understand people who choose to live abroad,  yet stick to their community of expats where all they do is complain about the difference of culture and how hard it is to build meaningful friendships with locals. Everyone thinks they?re open-minded, few actually are.</p><p>The best books come from life experience, not from reading other books. Live, then write.</p><p>Everyone makes mistakes, but smart people learn and move on.</p><p>Uncertainty is an inevitable component. Dont let it paralyze you. Successful people all made attempts despite not feeling ready.</p><p>They call you talented when you simply overcame the years of struggles they tried to avoid.</p><p>Seven reminders: 1) Your expectations are your problem 2) Many limits only exist in your mind 3) Creativity is nurtured 4) No one has everything figured out 5) No practice, no real understanding 6) Money without meaning is bitter 7) Detachment ? emotionless</p><p>The day you realize the world doesnt revolve around you is the day your real friendships begin.</p><p>Many think that experience and age necessarily correlate. Living the same year over and over again for several decades isnt experience.</p><p>Trading teaches you:  patience, emotional control, risk management, the importance of timing, navigating uncertainty, ignoring the noise, mass psychology, cutting losses, doubling down on winners, importance of skin in the game, economy ? stock market, its just money.</p><p>The assumptions you make about others are your problem.</p><p>Relax, there is always another opportunity.</p><p>Too many people think exclusively in terms of monetary, transactional value. The idea of helping for free never crosses their mind. The most valuable things in life have little to do with money. But a rich mind is necessary to understand that.</p><p>If you have fun working, you are already more successful than most.</p><p>Dont miss a new opportunity because you were busy regretting a missed opportunity.</p><p>Smart people learn from the truth. They want to face their own shortcomings. The others get offended by the truth. They want to stay in a comfortable illusion.</p><p>Ego and insecurities always go together.</p><p>Everyone is convinced they understand themselves until they spend extended periods of time alone.</p><p>College isn?t a scam just because it didn?t work out for you. Just like for any investment, it?s your responsibility to do your own research, assess the upside potential, the downside risks, and take responsibility for your own life.</p><p>Give up on success if you cant manage your emotions.</p><p>Knowledge is useless without the courage to execute on it.</p><p>The first success is the hardest: little money, lack of confidence, pressure from family, little support, no connection, unrefined skills The second success is much simpler: financial flexibility, self-belief, people trust you, your mind somehow evolved, you know what to do</p><p>The more meaningful efforts you make, the less anxious you feel. Anxiety is your soul complaining about how distracted you are. Focus. Work towards a long-term goal. That?s the recipe of peace.</p><p>Whats one important skill you wish you had learned earlier in life?</p><p>Happy people are just people who made practicing gratitude a habit.</p><p>If someone makes wrong assumptions about you, its not your problem.</p><p>You dont become a great investor by blindly following quotes from great investors nor do you become a great thinker just by reading tons of books. You want to grow, you need to put yourself out there, take risks, make mistakes, struggle, overcome your worries, experience life.</p><p>Every time you think someone is ignoring you, ask yourself why you feel entitled to their attention at all.</p><p>Stress decreases your ability to clearly see the bigger picture. Learn to relax, you will get smarter.</p><p>Anything valuable takes time to build. Successful people are patient people.</p><p>People who claim its too late to start something are just rationalizing their lack of courage.</p><p>Reading is not enough. To improve your thinking, think more. To improve your writing, write more. To improve your eloquence, speak more. Strike the right balance between time alone and time with other curious, driven minds. Compound on years, decades. Thats all you need.</p><p>The purpose of money is to live the life you want, but most people never even question what they want.</p><p>Games in easy mode are boring. Life is a game. Challenge yourself. You will have fun. You will be happy.</p><p>Growth is the art of pushing without breaking and gifting yourself time to heal.</p><p>Unsuccessful people envy and dislike people who grow fast. Smart people learn from, help, and befriend them. The second mindset coincidentally also leads to success.</p><p>Its normal to change your mind often when you value education.</p><p>People respect you when you fearlessly build your dreams, not because youre older or credentialed.</p><p>You want to attract happy people, be happy. Four pillars: 1) Healthy lifestyle: nutrition, workout, self-awareness, sleep 2) Meaningful activities: family, personal growth, impact on society 3) Education: unlearn wrong beliefs, fortify basics 4) Self-esteem: trust yourself</p><p>Not sure why so many people think that retirement = doing nothing. It?s precisely doing everything you love. All the wealthy people are ?retired.?</p><p>A hungry man wants food. A sick man wants health. A tired man wants sleep. A lonely man wants love. A wise man wants what he has. A talented man wants freedom. An anxious man wants peace. A stagnant man wants growth. A depressed man wants meaning. A successful man wants to help.</p><p>Anxiety is when you subconsciously attempt to live life on someone else?s pace.</p><p>Things you need patience for:  building a company, investing money, raising kids, reading, thinking and writing, meditating, getting fit, getting smart, listening and understanding other perspectives, becoming fluent in other foreign languages, building friendships and love</p><p>The problem with many people, they think that free = worthless. Education is free. Meditation is free. Walking is free. Writing is free. Pushups, squats, situps are free. Being kind and respectful is free. Stimulating conversations with friends are free.</p><p>Everyone is clueless when they start. Some people just dont make it an excuse.</p><p>The ideal job makes you wake up every morning with excitement.</p><p>The most common cause of failure is self-censorship. No one was qualified when they started.</p><p>Dont wait for someone to tell you what to do. Everyone else is also busy figuring things out.</p><p>Take risks as if no one is watching.</p><p>Nowadays, successful means knows how to use the Internet.</p><p>You get all the motivation you need once your goals are clear.</p><p>The only thing you should be scared of: looking back at the end of your life, realizing you did nothing, because you were scared of criticism, because you thought people cared about your failures.</p><p>You made a mistake, learn, move on. You missed an opportunity, move on. You got rejected, self-reflect, move on. You broke up with your partner, move on. You failed a business, cut losses, move on. You wasted years, dont ruminate, move on. Dont get stuck in the past. Move on.</p><p>Being rude and acting tough don?t signal intelligence, only immaturity.</p><p>The smart can legally steal from the ignorant, it?s called trading.</p><p>Things you can buy with money: - peace of mind - safer neighborhood - freedom to quit a job - ability to invest longer term - creating for the sake of creating - more time with family and friends - time to read, meditate, relax, think - freedom to grow at your own pace</p><p>Wealth strategy: invest, create, connect Health strategy:  fast, exercise, drop sugar, relax Love/friendship strategy:  be honest, trusting, giving Marketing strategy:  satisfied customers Parenting strategy:  listen, be a role model Happiness strategy:  be mindful, grateful</p><p>Average habits, average life. Great habits, great life. Its that simple.</p><p>First become rich, then help people at scale.</p><p>The Internet can sometimes be the teacher, the parent, the mentor, the friend, the hope that you never had.</p><p>You will always wish you had invested more and earlier. You will always wish you had spent more time with certain people when you could. You will always wish you had made better, smarter decisions when younger. Hindsight bias. You learned precisely because of your mistakes.</p><p>Wealth is about being able to spend as much time as you want with people you love.</p><p>100% of the successful people I know are busy with meaningful work, and their other main priority is family. You want them to make time for you, a stranger, be ready to add value.</p><p>If you are not ready for a decade of consistent hard work, you are not ready for talent.</p><p>When you complain and blame,  you signal that you are the type of person who neither thinks deeply nor wants to take responsibility. That?s also the kind of person no one wants to help.</p><p>The problem isnt that youve changed, the problem is that people who stopped growing expect you to do the same.</p><p>The best marketing: building trust over the years.</p><p>What?s the most important lesson 2020 taught you so far?</p><p><span>Something like this: <a href="https://t.co/Fx1yy8FC1E">https://t.co/Fx1yy8FC1E</a></span></p><p>Investing is a marathon. Staying fit is a marathon. Getting educated is a marathon. Creating a business is a marathon. Building a loving family is a marathon. Maintaining a clear mind is a marathon. Building meaningful friendships is a marathon. And you run them simultaneously.</p><p>People who dont think that money has an enormous impact on mental health have never been, throughout their lives, both poor and financially free.</p><p>You can basically tell someone is neither loving nor being loved by the amount of anger they display online.</p><p>What most people call friends are actually acquaintances. You notice your true friends only when you hit rock bottom. And true friendships are rarer than what most people think.</p><p>Absolutely no one succeeds without struggle.</p><p>You want an attractive and smart partner, become one.</p><p>A life-changing realization: Everyone has 24 hours a day, no one cares about your excuses, and you are responsible for the life you live.</p><p>I still never met anyone consistently highly successful in all the areas of their lives, who wasn?t also immensely humble. Arrogance is disguised insecurities.</p><p>Im sure a lot of writers started to write because they couldnt find what they wanted to read. Probably the same happens with many entrepreneurs, engineers, musicians, artists. Create what you want.</p><p>Some will call you superficial because you take care of yourself. Some will call you arrogant because you are self-confident. Some will call you evil because you are rich. Some will call you selfish because you are focused on your work. Ignore the labels. You know your worth.</p><p>Building a business is how you study business.</p><p>Eloquence determines your success in relationships, in business, in life. And theres no secret: think and write often, teach and converse often, meet strangers and get uncomfortable often. Clarity of thought is like a superpower.</p><p>Ironic how people who never built anything valuable in their lives are always the most adamant to criticize the work of others.</p><p>What are some science-fiction books you think everyone should read at least once?</p><p>Everyone wants to be smart, few are willing to spend years in solitude iterating on their own thoughts.</p><p>If you always wait until you are sure you understand exactly what you do, you will end up doing nothing. Uncertainty is an inevitable part of a successful life.</p><p>The smarter you get, the less prone you are to claim that anything is ?impossible,? because you slowly grasp the true complexity of our reality, and you understand it goes way beyond anything a single mind can process.</p><p>Get rid of refined carbs.

There are a bunch of perspectives that take years to acquire and it?s not your responsibility to educate every single immature person out who won?t make the effort to listen. Especially when Twitter is full of nice people too.</p><p>If they lack logic, there?s no point to argue. If they are logical, there?s no need to argue. Many people out there are simply not aware of their own deficiencies, don?t get caught into foolish games.</p><p>Great teachers just make you notice who you are.</p><p>A 20-year-old broke student is much wealthier than a 70-year-old multimillionaire.

Imo a key element to ?get it? is language proficiency + sensitivity. There?s a lot of implicit and communication is partly based on ?reading the air? (?????).

Still never sent any email, sorry ?? Will just send one once the book is ready. Will announce it on Twitter anyway, but a mailing list is convenient in case you stop using Twitter but still remain interested by the upcoming book, or if my account gets suspended??</p><p>If you grew up with smart, loving parents, you already had one of the biggest advantages in life.</p><p>Few people understand that. Some people have their preconceptions about someone, a certain mental model, and whatever you say, they will focus on the negative, and assume you owe them an explanation, and if you reply something great, they just disregard it. (I block them btw.)</p><p>The art of reading. Average: constantly listen to their inner voice, judge, think in terms of agree/disagree, try to speed read Educated: understand the background of the writer, put aside old beliefs, seek to understand new perspectives, re-read slowly, put in practice</p><p>Financial freedom: 1) You don?t have to tolerate people you dislike 2) You have as much time as you want with your beloved 3) You have time to read and learn whatever you want 4) You have plenty of sleep, healthy food, workouts, rest 5) You can focus on building long-term</p><p>You never see doers complain.

Adjust yourself to your partner.</p><p>Every single successful person out there probably felt like giving up a hundred times before reaching their goal. Sometimes, you just gotta keep pushing, regardless of how you feel.</p><p>You become rich by owning an asset whose value keeps growing. That should include your mind.</p><p>You regret 100% of the things you do when angry.</p><p>Thank you ! ????</p><p>Reminders: 1) People barely have time to think about you, let alone your mistakes 2) Before criticizing your parents, picture yourself at their age with their experience 3) You won?t believe it until you do it, but you can learn way more than you think 4) Discipline is talent</p><p>The fewer your opinions on everything, the better your results. The reason: success requires focus on your own work.</p><p>Maybe time alone with a great book is the pill most need.</p><p>If you only learn from average people, don?t be surprised to get an average life.</p><p>Personal principle: only learn from people who have what you want. Money?  They better be financially free Fitness and nutrition?  They better be fit and healthy Love and friendship? They better be in happy long-term relationships Success? They better have remarkable results</p><p>A great company: a group of talented individuals who would rather work alone unless they are surrounded by competent coworkers.</p><p>There are a lot of kind, great people out there. Dont lose faith because of a few angry people.</p><p>That?s unfortunately a privileged position that most out there cannot have, because the parents themselves are clueless about it.</p><p>Im not a conspirationist, but Im pretty sure its on purpose if you just connect the dots between governments, money, and the big industries out there.</p><p>Things school usually doesnt teach: - nutrition - kindness - self-reliance - mindfulness - relationships - healthy habits - love of reading - money / finance - emotional control - long-term thinking - importance of writing Fortunately, its never too late to learn.</p><p>Ive had the exact same thoughts. This pattern is pretty common from what I saw, struggling parents nurturing very smart kids, and vice-versa. Maybe an environment where they are surrounded by people more talented than them, and have to compete and grow to get what they want.</p><p>Funny how it works, in many cases, the luckier and comfier you were whilst growing up, the more entitled and the less grateful you feel. Some of the happiest people I know grew up in the middle of war and famine. Others almost died. There is no gratitude without perspective.</p><p>Success in five steps: 1) Believing in your growth potential 2) Cutting off unsuccessful naysayers 3) Years of struggles with little results 4) Dots start connecting, vision clarifies 5) Everything suddenly works out</p><p>Talented people are just people who learned to embrace time alone focused.</p><p>You want to know if people truly value you for your current ideas, conceal your name, credentials, and past achievements.</p><p>A sign of intelligence: You spend more time thinking about what you love than what you dislike.</p><p>It?s impossible to get wealthy if you keep a ?poor? mentality: hating the rich, stating life is unfair, complaining. In the past decade alone, an internet connection, English proficiency, and some curiosity, were all you needed to get rich. It will be the same for the 2020s.</p><p>Expect a lot from yourself, expect little from others, you will grow and be happy.</p><p>I self-reflected about the pros and the cons, but I?ll never do it, not worth it. Even at this stage (~100k followers), I occasionally get threats and insults. Not foolish enough to ruin my life just to entertain people. I think it?s a powerful leverage, but I don?t need money.</p><p>Yeah, a circle of close friends who are all working in different directions (Youtube, business, artist, MMA fighter, musician, ...) I choose people who take/took risks on purpose: they usually have the most interesting background stories, and we get along pretty well.</p><p>If you are scared of being hated, give up on success already. Attracting envy is inevitable when youre doing things right.</p><p>Yup! I also think most parents barely understand their own emotions, that?s why they can?t teach either.</p><p>Best things a parent can do for their kids: - being kind and loving to their spouse - being an intellectually curious role model, encouraging trial and error - listening and understanding, not lecturing - teaching them about money, emotions, health, principles - buying books</p><p>Only fools think that complaining and sharing their anger with others will improve things.</p><p>What?s one concept, idea, perspective, that you wish you had learned much earlier in life?</p><p>Entrepreneurs are just people who got tired of waiting for the perfect job.</p><p>Oh btw, I know we all have life-constraints and we feel the need to learn ?fast,? but if you think long-term, it?s much more rewarding to have fun and take your time. I don?t know how consciousness and the mind work, but I personally learn more efficiently if relaxed.</p><p>It depends on you, and on what you do whilst watching/listening (notes-taking, pausing and reflect, etc.) I personally prefer books because I appreciate silence, but it?s a personal preference.</p><p>It?s a shame that as we grow up, most people no longer find the time to get absorbed into a great book for a few consecutive hours.</p><p>My end goal is peace of mind. Anything that creates long-term anxiety or envy, like constantly watching successful people living their lives, is a no go. Key word is ?constantly,? it?s fine to be inspired once in a while. Walks are a great habit imo. Short answer: it depends.</p><p>People care about your opinion only once it?s backed by results.</p><p>You will always think you?ve missed an opportunity. Just focus on the next one.</p><p>Become the friend you wanna talk to. Become the spouse you wanna be with. Become the parent you wanted to grow up with. Become the child you wish you had. Become the mentor you never had. Become the creator of products you love. Become someone who lives on their own terms.</p><p>Simple doesn?t mean easy indeed.</p><p>Life is simple. Forget what you lost. Treasure what you have. Work hard to get what you want.</p><p>A sign of happiness: you yearn for the success of others. A sign of success: you stop feeling envy. A sign of education: you are calm.</p><p>Love it !</p><p>Most people who say they want to be rich, fit, talented, don?t actually want it. Anyone can say anything. Your desire is reflected in your actions, in your efforts, in your attempts.</p><p>Thank you ! ??</p><p>The angriest people tend to be those who are unloved, but most dont realize they will never be loved unless they change.</p><p>Too many people mistake education and degree. You can have one without the other.</p><p>Trust me, on Twitter I saw some people quote-tweet tagging people just to try to stir some conflicts. I block these people automatically.</p><p>Replied elsewhere in the thread, we dont have the same definition of educated. Its impossible to be truly educated without being humbled.</p><p>The educated mind is calm. It understands itself, it is humble because it understands the true complexity of the reality. Many people think education is about credentials and status, but it?s hard to blame them for being misled.</p><p>If you enjoy seeing people fight with each other, you are not happy.</p><p>My definition of an educated mind isn?t the popular one. I can frame it this way: you aren?t educated as you as long you aren?t calm and self-understanding.</p><p>Ego disappears once you are educated.</p><p>I?ve learned that it?s often a bad idea to try to guess the top ?? But yeah, I think we are about to have immense structural changes when it comes to the whole financial system. We?ll look back in two decades thinking it was obvious; right now is the time for educated bets.</p><p>99% of your worries are worthless, but you only understand that after you have health issues.</p><p>Septic shock, I truly thought it was over whilst waiting for the ambulance, but they fortunately came quickly ?? Recovered and doing great now, but it did make me question all my life priorities.</p><p>Stay away from all the people who think a conversation is about winning or losing.</p><p>You are not lonely, you are just surrounded by the wrong people.</p><p>Maturity is just trauma you overcame by being brave and taking responsibility.</p><p>Thank you ! ??</p><p>If someone thinks a relationship is about winning or losing, Im better off without that someone right from the start.</p><p>I think empathy is essential for meaningful relationships and a meaningful life.</p><p>Yup, no sustainable damage fortunately, thank you! Reminds me that I started my book because I thought it would be nice to leave something behind for the next generations just in case haha.</p><p>I think its easy to get caught into the games of society were all playing and forget what truly matters and what doesnt really matter. Once its clearer, you can focus your time and attention on what will bring you peace.</p><p>I personally suddenly leveled up after I almost died last year ?? Its basically about perspective. A good understanding of the context of your life helps. Plenty of ways to achieve that: practicing mindfulness, writing about yourself, talking to the previous generations...</p><p>Many people think they lack talent, they actually lack emotional control. The right words, the right reactions, the right decisions, its all clearer if you are emotionally detached.</p><p>I think high sensitivity is a great asset, especially for creative purposes.</p><p>Theres a high correlation between people who read a lot of fiction as kids, and people high in empathy.</p><p>Its about defining the right amount of risks, yup. But overall, at small doses, the struggles of life make us stronger in the long run imo. Up to our self-assessment to figure out how much we think we can take without breaking ; the mind has its antifragile features.</p><p>Thank you ! :-)</p><p>Best way to see who your real friends are is to be open about your weaknesses. Some will jump down your throat immediately. Others will support you. Focus on the latter.</p><p>If you hear a bunch of people discussing a life-changing investment opportunity at the same time, get ready to sell, not to buy.</p><p>Its simple. If you are surrounded by happy, smart, kind people, you are doing things right. If not, spend more time on self-reflection and figure out how you can change. Because whether thats comfortable to hear or not, your relationships reflect who you are.</p><p>Minimize friction in the other areas of your life, that will increase your likelihood of staying focused for long periods of time.</p><p>Funny to see people in their twenties worried that ?it?s too late.? There?s no competition out there. Stable job. Entertainment. The vast majority of people gave up on self-improvement and self-education. You ?just? need to keep up your efforts to be the 1% in your thirties.</p><p>Not at all, it?s just relaxing for me.</p><p>I?m working on a book mostly based on my life.</p><p>At the beginning, I forced myself to go to some caf‚ every day and stay there for a minimum of time; but after you do it for a while, it becomes a habit and you have thoughts flowing out pretty naturally.</p><p>I became a lot more eloquent too. Public speaking skills stem directly from mind clarity, and that?s mostly nurtured through daily self-reflection and writing. Concision is also acquired if you consistently make the effort.</p><p>As long as you have a personal goal that keeps you going, any way is fine. It?s important to have fun imo. Experiment until you figure out a routine that allows you to feel the growth of your mind weeks after weeks.</p><p>I?ve been writing every day for several years now, and I can confirm it?s one of the healthiest habits if you aim for mind clarity.</p><p>Been on Twitter for a while now, some people start their reply with dumb, nonsense, wrong, and expect a discussion...</p><p>I never block people for disagreeing, I do it when people are rude, angry, cynical, without trying to understand my perspective. If you cant be respectful, you will waste a lot of learning opportunities in life, because no one successful has time to deal with someone unlikable.</p><p>My upcoming book actually expands on the topic. I had a pretty unique, unrepeatable set of circumstances that made it possible.</p><p>I think this one is a rare case, because good and bad decisions compound in life, so its very unlikely that you make any significant u-turn after several decades of complacency. But it does happen, I consider the likelihood similar to winning the lottery though. (Need luck.)</p><p>And you probably also learned that the clarity of the mind is directly correlated to the health of the body.</p><p>I guess Id say, if you experience the latter without the former, you will lack empathy and the self-awareness of how privileged you were.</p><p>The people who have the best understanding of an issue: those who experienced both sides. - unfit and fit - poor and rich - angry and calm - weak and strong - ignored and loved - anxious and relaxed - depressed and happy - insecure and confident - slow-witted and clear-minded</p><p><span>Something like this: <a href="https://t.co/Fx1yy8FC1E">https://t.co/Fx1yy8FC1E</a></span></p><p>I think a lot of people arent even aware of their own hypocrisy. They are the same who struggle in their relationships or personal life, because truly, all you need is self-awareness, but thats a pretty scarce trait nowadays.</p><p>The only people who can be fully honest at all times are the financially free + anonymous.</p><p>No one ever got good at something by watching others do it.</p><p>A masterpiece created in 24 hours is still a masterpiece. Average work that took 10 years is still average work. How long you spent working on something is irrelevant. People want results, not proof of work.</p><p>Many people have been conditioned into being obedient, loyal citizens who will defend their country and government, promoting taxes for social justice, even though they have absolutely no idea how central banks or the financial markets actually work.</p><p>Life rewards those who take initiatives, rarely those who stick to the status quo.</p><p>The most insightful takes come from people who overcame poverty: they know what it?s like to be in a constant state of stress, worried about even the slightest expenditures, forced to eat cheap, unhealthy food for decades, forced to deal with people with little common sense.</p><p>I guess risk tolerance is a matter of age and priorities, its much easier to go high-risk high-reward at 20 than at 35 with two kids. Thats also why I often advocate people in their twenties to risk (and potentially fail) a lot. Best period of your life to do so.</p><p>Great example. Same here.</p><p>People who built wealth from scratch all acted a bit irresponsibly.</p><p>No one will help you unless you show potential first. No one will love you unless you show trust first. No one will like you unless you show respect first.</p><p>Most people who watch financial charts thinking, I would be rich if I had invested, dont realize they likely would have sold at the beginning of the bull market.</p><p>Talented people simply made tons of mistakes when you werent there to see them.</p><p>I?m pretty sure most successful people think along the same lines, not because you cannot learn something from everyone, but because you can learn so much more, by several orders of magnitude, from extraordinary people.</p><p>The only opinions worth listening to are those that are backed with results. The rest is noise. Prove yourself first if you want to get anyone?s attention.</p><p>Same here. Anyone a bit smart can figure out creative freedom is about money, and they follow the money first.</p><p>We are all better off if smart people are also busy building and creating instead of just managing a portfolio.</p><p>Most efficient way to make a positive impact on society: start a business, get financially free, hire like-principled people, gain influence and support, actually make a difference at scale.</p><p>Arguing is for fools. Just put your money where your beliefs are. Results will speak.</p><p>Successful people didnt ask for validation before creating something new.</p><p>Learning from the people you wish to resemble, but you will find your own path during the process.</p><p>Many relationships are a mess because young people thoughtlessly rush into them without understanding themselves or others, just because theyre embarrassed about being single.

But in real life, no one cares about your excuses. You get results, or you get left behind.</p><p>Some young people spend a lot of time justifying why they take no initiative. Truth is, they dont show any ambition because theyre scared of looking ridiculous if they fail. Forget about external validation. The sooner you start living for yourself, the happier youll be.</p><p>The worst mistakes are always what you dont do: not being grateful not learning useful skills not asking that person out not taking care of your health not investing in that asset not selling when everyone does not fasting food  information not building long-term friendships.</p><p>You have to be around people who love themselves if you want a chance to be loved.</p><p>I guess you need to live it to truly understand it.</p><p>People who don?t care about making money, who focus on learning and creating something useful, make money.

They are busy working on themselves.</p><p>Even within one decade, friends you have at 20 and friends you have at 30 are completely different if you grew as an individual indeed.</p><p>Yeah, precisely in the current context. We?ve been so conditioned to run around based on ?fomo? and ?busyness? that we don?t even realize how much of life is being wasted on worrying about what isn?t even worth it.</p><p>These are great advice.</p><p>Take the time to pause. Is that truly how I want to spend the next few years or decades of my life? If not, think up a plan. Make progress every day. Most people spend a lifetime with no awareness of what they truly want. A few months of self-reflection can save decades.</p><p>Whats the best advice youve heard from your parents?</p><p>All your relationships instantly improve once you are mindful when you talk.</p><p>You become more competitive once you care more about yourself than your competitors.</p><p>What most people call ?talent? is regularity of efforts over long periods of time.</p><p>Mental growth follows the same rules as physical growth. Just hit difficult books and self-reflect instead of hitting the gym and rest.</p><p>Anxiety fades away once you get rid of toxic people and unhealthy food.</p><p>Speaking clearly is fairly simple if you truly understand what you are talking about.</p><p>Successful people didnt wait until someone told them what to do. Initiative is the talent.</p><p>A good idea is 1% of the work.</p><p>Thank you ! ??</p><p>Everybody should at least once in their lives achieve something few have done, just so they can realize it doesn?t require any special talent to make an impact, just consistent efforts, desire to learn, initiative, courage to fail, and hope.</p><p>You are most impressive when you couldnt care less about impressing.</p><p>Knowing how to relax under pressure is an underrated skill.</p><p>You will think completely differently in one decade. Write today so you dont forget how you were.</p><p>You dont get peace if you are scared of self-reflecting. You dont get talent if you are scared of sacrifices. You dont get love if you are scared of trusting. You dont get growth if you are scared of failing.</p><p><span>what is crypto <a href="https://t.co/Os7IMYkOpi">https://t.co/Os7IMYkOpi</a></span></p><p>With all the ?economic stimulus? going on,  maybe more people will start wondering what gives a few elites the right to print out in seconds what most people have to slave away their entire lives to earn. And maybe they will look into another alternative.</p><p>You want more original thoughts, you need to think more: don?t be passive in your reading, pause and see how ideas relate to your life; don?t be mechanical in your conversations, pause and dig into uncomfortable topics; don?t be mindless in your living, be aware  present.</p><p>Its hard to be truly creative if you dont have time to think. Avoid busyness.</p><p>You are not smart when you disagree, you are smart when you understand the perspective of others.</p><p>The best opportunities in life always dress in scary ways.</p><p>Its just like at school, you see everyone taking notes, but some do it very mechanically, and some do it mindfully by attaching the new pieces to some solid foundations. In the end, its whatever works for you. The Internet gives us the freedom to figure out our own mind.</p><p>Wealth starts once you make time to read books.</p><p>Never take anyones attention for granted, especially for the people closest to you. Keep learning, renew yourself, stay interesting.</p><p>Starting from scratch with no money, no guidance, no connection, can feel like an unfair dead end, but once you notice your best assets: curiosity, the Internet, courage, creativity, and nothing to lose, miracles are suddenly not so out of reach.</p><p>A timeless book is part of my current vision, doing my best to deliver ! ??</p><p>You no longer have time to criticize others once you have meaningful work.</p><p>What?s one book you re-read every few years?</p><p>Short-term success is mostly luck. Long-term success is mostly skill.</p><p>If a book takes five years to write: four years are about exploring the world, meeting people, accumulating unique experiences, six months are about connecting the dots, letting ideas mature, self-reflecting, five are actual writing, and the last month about chopping out 90%.</p><p>Thank you ! ??</p><p>Thank you ! ??</p><p>Thank you ! ??</p><p>Successful people are just people really good at ignoring distractions.</p><p>Pretty much never. This is more related to my ongoing book. From what I experience, your daily mood matters a lot when it comes to how much depth you draw from reading. Its difficult to deal with the novelty bias: first times, its great, the 50th time, youre not so sure. ??</p><p>Writing is also a way to understand how subjective your perception of the reality is. Read what you wrote a week ago. It feels different. Wait for one more week, read it again. It feels different again. Thats why writing a great, timeless book is hard.</p><p>Life is over, not when your body no longer responds, but when your mind stops being curious.</p><p>The highest sign of education: you are calm.</p><p>Anxiety is when deep down, you know you aren?t growing, because you never try and fail.</p><p>Self-reflect before life forces you to.</p><p>Many want to be crazy rich, few want to take crazy bets.</p><p>Stay away from people who see the negative everywhere.</p><p>A country where people aren?t incentivized to work harder and take entrepreneurial risks is a dying country.</p><p>People love stories where the heroes struggle, then grow, then succeed. You will love your life if you struggle, then grow, then succeed.</p><p>No one rich will sell you a course on how to get rich. By definition, they dont need your money.</p><p>People around you change after you change.</p><p>Personal experience. I?ve had quite a ride during the past decade. Twitter is my diary ; my upcoming book is the whole story.</p><p>Life becomes fun once you have learned to learn.</p><p>Yeah, it often requires a bit of luck and a few people taking a chance on you, and when you are stuck in a negative, cynical mindset, you are more likely to repel most opportunities. But I believe the Internet is improving things, and its barely just the beginning.</p><p>I?m sure a lot of people had to grow up in a ?toxic? environment: belittled, deceived, shamed, guilted. But if you don?t give up, and keep pushing your efforts, and finally escape the gravity of that black hole of constant drama and nonsense, you end up freer than anyone else.</p><p>Stranger than fiction is a cool movie btw.</p><p>Reality is the best science-fiction movie ever made, and you are in full immersion, and you have a say in the script.</p><p>99% of your worries dont matter. The remaining 1% is the health of your beloved and your own. Dont get caught up in the insanity of the games we play in society.</p><p>Celebrity is mentally unhealthy. Value your privacy if you can. Know the downsides if your career involves being a public figure.</p><p>Luck can make you rich, but only intelligence will keep you rich.</p><p>Understanding software is the new knowing how to read.</p><p>Understanding why you need the money you think you need is more important than making money.</p><p>You are successful when you want everyone else to be confident and happy too.</p><p>Thanks for the kind words ! ??</p><p>Manipulative people think they are smarter than others until they realize they are all alone long-term.</p><p>Reading without the intention to challenge your beliefs is far less useful.</p><p>The smarter you get, the more loosely you hold your beliefs.</p><p>Your business decisions are your responsibility. Your financial investments are your responsibility. The relationships you build are your responsibility. Your health, fitness, mental clarity are your responsibility. 24 hours a day. Everything has a cost. Manage time wisely.</p><p>Writing every day makes you smarter. Being mindful every day makes you calmer.

If you stay hungry, success is inevitable.</p><p>If you truly value freedom, you will start your own business. No job will pay you to do what truly makes you happy.</p><p>I think people who don?t come up with their own thoughts won?t last long enough to build anything meaningful. It?s just not fun. The only people left after a few years are here for the ?right? purposes ; not sure what?s the point of creating something not self-representative.</p><p>On Instagram, you can easily fake how you actually look like. On Twitter, its much harder to fake how you actually think.

Go for it, life is generous when you are bold.</p><p>You are not failing because of your circumstances, your parents, your bad teachers, or society, you are failing because of the victim mentality.</p><p>No book will teach you self-confidence. It has to be earned through years of efforts, failures, self-reflection, growth, accomplishments.</p><p>Making people think is more useful than giving them answers.</p><p>Thank you! ??</p><p>Whats one thing you highly value today that you didnt ten years ago?</p><p>Age is irrelevant.

There is no point discussing with people who are convinced they are right. There is no point discussing with people who cant imagine someone elses perspective.</p><p>You want kids to become self-reliant adults, give them the opportunity to struggle.</p><p>Happy people are all building or creating something meaningful to them. Its impossible to be confident and at peace without expressing yourself.</p><p>Intelligence is also about not overthinking things you cant control anyway.</p><p><span>The whole story about how my worldview was built is developed in my upcoming book, but I once wrote this: <a href="https://t.co/9Z8GmFc08Q">https://t.co/9Z8GmFc08Q</a></span></p><p>Success is nearly impossible without supportive people at your side.

Sometimes, I check out some other parts of Twitter, and I am reminded: most people dont even know how the financial system works, they just stick to dogmas such as rich = bad.</p><p>Spending hours talking about politics never made anyone happier or smarter.</p><p>Cut off anyone who takes your time for granted.</p><p>In ten words or less: what?s your ?dream? ten years from now?</p><p>We really need to stop glorifying working long hours.

Change your habits, diet, routine, relationships, efforts, mindset, environment, and your mind will be reborn completely different after a few years.</p><p>The best feature of books: read it once, wait for a few years, read it again, it has become a different book.</p><p>Some people waste years fixing problems a few hours of clear thinking could have avoided.</p><p>All the best for this new journey ! ??</p><p>Everyday, be better than who you were.

When information is no longer controlled by a few entities, people naturally reach consensus and figure out the truths amongst the lies and traps laid by the big institutions before. An epidemic of global distrust has started.</p><p>And when it comes to learning, once you start believing you cannot, its over. Beliefs precede actions. And Ive met a lot of smart people, who happened to have unfavorable circumstances (work part-time to help parents financially..) with low self-esteem because of bad grades.</p><p>The biggest problem of school isnt that most kids spend two decades learning in an unadapted, inefficient way. The real problem is how much self-confidence is broken in the process. Success in life is so much more about creativity and courage than being able to memorize fast.</p><p>Its funny, I didnt realize the tweet could be read as: boast about this instead: which is of course, not the case ??</p><p>You should probably not boast about: - how many hours you work every day - how many people youve dated - how often you drink / party - how little sleep you get Better metrics: - how healthy, fit you are - how much value you create - how much time you spend with people you love</p><p>Ignore whats trending on Twitter. Its mentally healthier.</p><p>The thing to not do is to react to people around you. Words are just words, but people dont forget them when they hurt, and many sadly break years of trust when they could just have waited the storm out.</p><p>The day you start caring about reputation is the day you stop growing.</p><p>The best thing to do when you feel like you?re having a bad day is nothing.</p><p>The secret of good writing is to actually sound like a human being.</p><p>The smartest people never take themselves too seriously.</p><p>To change the world, change yourself. To change yourself, change your actions. To change your actions, change your thoughts. To change your thoughts, change your habits. To change your habits, change your environment.</p><p>Being able to take criticism with humility, self-reflect, and change what you do, is the talent.</p><p>Haha ?? People who have been following me for the past two years know Im mostly here to write about my own experience, with some ups and downs, and metrics like number of followers are the least of my worries, but I wanted to point this out because its getting spammy lately.</p><p>You are happy when you want younger people to succeed faster than you did.</p><p>The more you seek the validation of others, the more likely you are lying to yourself.</p><p>In 2020, being contrarian is no big deal: - be fit - be calm - be happy - avoid cynicism - avoid groupthink - value your family - have time to think - avoid constant stimulation - do what you said you?d do - only speak when you understand - take responsibility for your own life</p><p>I think anyone with a minimum of self-respect and intelligence, who was once bullied by a group of people, despises these mimetic behaviors, and will refuse to ever take part in any sort of groupthink.</p><p>If people wanted the truth, everyone would be self-educated independent thinkers. Most people just want to be validated.</p><p>If you feel offended because someone isnt giving you the attention you want, you are unfocused.</p><p>Most people care more about feeling smart than being smart.</p><p>As you get smarter, you stop taking everything personally, because you realize the world doesnt revolve around you.</p><p>You only need to succeed once to get financial freedom, and you can try as many times as you want.</p><p>Most people dont deeply understand themselves until they live abroad and notice how much of their thoughts and beliefs were pure conditioning.</p><p>Underrated feature of Twitter: it teaches you to not react to people who completely miss the point.</p><p>Personal observations going against what society had taught me: - 50%+ of happiness is in financial freedom. - Beauty is mostly objective. - You dont need carbohydrates.  - Breakfast is not important either. - Governments, banks, etc, are not allies. - Family is essential.</p><p>You stop yelling at strangers online once you are happy in real life.</p><p>Facts dont care about your opinion.</p><p>The smarter you get, the less you enjoy small talk, because you value your time.</p><p>To get things done faster, imagine your deadline is today, every day, for a few years.</p><p>The most successful people I know are humble, working hard, focused, calm.</p><p>The real waste of time: spending two decades learning mostly what you dont care about,  to get a job you dislike,  to buy and show off things you dont need, to compete against people who dont really care about you, and realize you lived the life someone else set for you.</p><p>Quiet time alone with a great book is also happiness.</p><p>The difference between weird and eccentric is how much you have in your bank account.</p><p>What you think you can do doesnt matter until you actually do it.</p><p>Read the news every day only if you want to think like everybody else. If you want to succeed, don?t.</p><p>The best school is the Internet + your curiosity + your good judgment + time alone.</p><p>Buying stuff you dont need to impress people who dont care.</p><p>Life is simple. Get rid of a few habits: processed food, inactivity, arguing Get rid of a few emotions: envy, inflated ego, anger Get rid of a few connections: insecure, insensitive, foolish people Get rid of a few expenditures: debt, status signaling, news You get happier.</p><p>A lot of things in life dont require your reaction.</p><p>If it cost you peace of mind, it wasn?t worth it.</p><p>There is no truly independent thinking without financial independence.</p><p>A sign of success: You want to keep a low profile.</p><p>You are successful when you are calm, loved, free.</p><p>Thats not your problem if people dont want to update their idea of you.</p><p>YouTube can be distraction or teacher. Instagram can be envy or art. Twitter can be anger or ideas. We have better tools than all our ancestors. It?s time to take responsibility.</p><p>Fail more often. No one is watching.</p><p>Paradise is when you are free to read and learn, deeply and slowly, unconstrained by any external validation or deadline, driven solely by your intellectual curiosity.</p><p>Fastest way to succeed is to stop looking for shortcuts.</p><p>You know they are happy in real life when they are not angry online.</p><p>Anonymity allows you to say the truth.</p><p>Most people who you think are smarter than you simply spent a lot more time thinking about difficult topics.</p><p>Most people dont understand that talent is just decades of mindful efforts. Or maybe they just dont want to believe that.</p><p>The smarter you get, the more you want to stay away from crowds.</p><p>Exercising makes you happier. Fasting makes you healthier. Investing makes you richer. Writing makes you smarter. Time alone makes you calmer.</p><p>Self-confidence comes after you repeatedly do what you thought you couldnt do.</p><p>Too many people are busy becoming someone else.</p><p>Dont be scared of competing with who you could be.</p><p>People who grow want the truth. The others want their beliefs validated.</p><p>Most people can?t think clearly because they are addicted to stimulation. Learn to appreciate quiet time, alone.</p><p>You get the attention of the whole humanity for 30 seconds. What important message would you broadcast?</p><p>The less you need, the more you get. Detachment improves execution.</p><p>Stop inventing imaginary problems. You will have time to solve real ones.</p><p>Thats why practicing with random strangers is so efficient. You know you will never meet them again, so there is no reason to be embarrassed.</p><p>A good writer is someone not scared of pressing the button delete over and over again. A successful person is someone not scared of trying over and over again. There is no greatness without persistence.</p><p>Quickly identifying when you are wrong is more useful than justifying how you are right.</p><p>Happy, successful people rarely criticize anyone. They don?t have time for that.</p><p>The smarter you get, the more you value freedom.</p><p>Spend enough time in an insane society, you will start questioning your own sanity.</p><p>You have time is a lie.</p><p>Dont ask for their opinion if youre gonna get angry when they disagree.</p><p>The smartest people I know are all carving their own unique path. They seek truth and progress, not validation.</p><p>To solve anxiety, imagine how it feels like: - to be financially free - to not owe anyone anything - to not need to prove anyone anything and keep that mindset in your daily life. It also works to find your purpose.</p><p>You understand what you dont understand once you write about it.</p><p>Success is simple. Learn to handle time alone.</p><p>People who have a great life gave up on a good life right from the start.</p><p>You wont get to the future you want if you dont understand the present youre in.</p><p>Fastest way to get something you want is to make it happen yourself.</p><p>Never make an impulsive decision during a bad day. Instead, go take a walk,  and think of what you can be grateful for.</p><p>The more successful you get, the less you care about convincing anybody, the more convincing you actually get.</p><p>Unlearning wrong beliefs is more useful than learning new beliefs.</p><p>It?s a no-brainer: I kickstarted everything after moving abroad (????). In second position, intermittent fasting really improved my life a lot.</p><p>Best decisions in life so far... - mindfulness - daily workout - moving abroad - writing every day - building trust with parents - investing, understanding money - eating once a day, little to no carbs - patiently waited for the right person - being honest under any circumstance</p><p>Dont mistake high cost of lifestyle and high quality of life.</p><p>Writing every day is difficult. Thats why you should do it.</p><p>Self-respect and self-reflection are all you need imo. The former requires self-honesty (we always have a good reason to do what we want instead of what we need.) The latter requires time alone. No amount of books can replace actual experience.</p><p>Changing your habits is the talent you need. Most cant because they lack mindfulness. Stop living on autopilot.</p><p>Every time you strongly disagree with someone smarter than you, try to understand their perspective and you will learn a lot.</p><p>Thank you ! ??</p><p>A sign of success: You want younger people to avoid your mistakes.</p><p>The best thing you can do for society is to take care of yourself first.</p><p>Most people don?t learn: they are busy judging instead of listening.</p><p>Its almost comical to see so many people in their twenties thinking its too late to start something.</p><p>You never feel lonely when you work towards a meaningful purpose.</p><p>The smarter you get,  the less you feel entitled.</p><p>There is no get-rich-quick scheme because there is no get-smart-quick scheme. You just read, write, self-reflect, maintain good habits, exchange ideas with friends, take risks, create, over and over again, year after year: both money and intelligence will follow you.</p><p>A useful skill: recognizing when your work sucks.</p><p>Anyone can be a talented musician in a decade. Anyone can be a polyglot in a decade. Anyone can be fit, smart in a decade. The problem isnt that you are a slow learner. The problem is that you cant stick to it for a decade.</p><p>You are boring when you spend your time talking about yourself.</p><p>If it starts feeling like work, take a break.</p><p>Reading too much is counterproductive if you seek originality. To think independently, think more, alone.</p><p>The less you care about looking stupid, the faster you learn.</p><p>Success requires a decade of efforts. Two good examples: 1) James Cameron started writing at 20 wrote The Terminator at 28 released at 30: overnight success 2) George Lucas started movies at 23 started writing Star Wars at 29 finished at 32 released at 33: overnight success</p><p>Put yourself into situations where you will probably embarrass yourself, and self-reflect / write about it later.</p><p>Your most important asset after health is common sense.</p><p>The ideal investment is something youre ready to hold forever. The ideal job is something youre ready to do forever. The ideal partner is someone youre ready to love forever.</p><p>Its healthy to not have an opinion on things you dont understand.</p><p>Self-education is the new entertainment.</p><p>In business, choose people with the same vision who think differently. In friendships, choose people with a different vision who think similarly. In love, choose someone with the same vision who thinks similarly.</p><p>You put out your best work the day you stop caring about how people will judge you.</p><p>Rejections and failures hurt temporarily. You just need a bit of courage. People afraid of pain don?t grow.</p><p>Smart people seek information that disproves their hypothesis. They are here to learn, not to feel good.</p><p>You didn?t learn about money at school because the system is incentivized to keep you ignorant. You weren?t taught to think  act independently because the system is incentivized to keep you obedient. Imagine if people consumed only what they needed. The system would crumble.</p><p>Things money can buy: - freedom to think - freedom to travel - freedom from jerks - freedom to learn slowly - freedom from an alarm clock - freedom from work you dislike - freedom from financial anxiety - freedom from low-cost nutrition - freedom to pursue a creative purpose</p><p><span>Thank you ! ??

Go out. Understand another culture. Fall in love. Trust unconditionally. Listen to people without judgment. Attempt something hard and new. Fail. Try again. Readjust more intelligently. That?s life.</p><p>Most people would work harder if they truly wanted what they claim they want.</p><p>All the successful people I know who had a breakthrough in their 30s worked hard and failed countless times in their 20s.</p><p>How to assess someones character: 1) Listen to what they dont talk about. 2) Pay attention to the questions they ask. 3) Look at how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 4) Listen to how they talk about their parents. 5) Look at how they actually spend their days.</p><p>You are happy when the success of others isnt uncomfortable.</p><p>My parents were immigrants, I immigrated myself, and I couldn?t agree more.

The real impressive achievements: listening,  understanding their point of view, being kind under all circumstances. Conversations are dancing, not boxing.</p><p>Same here.  Eating once a day has been life-changing.</p><p>These will change your perception of life: - mindfulness - writing every day - changing your diet - practicing gratitude - mutual, effortless love - near-death experience - spending years abroad - financial independence - losing someone you love - overcoming mental limitations</p><p>Dont seek productivity, seek meaning.</p><p>Look around you. You see many people in their 40s, 50s, 60s, who have complete breakdowns. They used to be smart and clearheaded. The human mind is just unpredictable. In moments of clarity, write. Your values, your framework. Past words will be allies when youre lost.</p><p>If they think they already know better, waste no more time on the conversation.</p><p>Relationships are simple. Throw away your ego. Learn to listen. Thats it.</p><p>You are always wrong to feel entitled.</p><p>Insecure people seek your weaknesses.

If you cant surround yourself with the right people, you will fail.</p><p>Commit to a few people. Commit to a few investments. Commit to a few skills. Commit to a few habits. Commitment is the secret for love, wealth, talent, and peace.</p><p>No. There are a lot of truths in novels. All the highly empathetic, smart people I know are (or were) fond of novels.</p><p>Don?t read books to escape the reality. Read books to build a better society. Don?t read books to feel good as you are. Read books to become a better person. Don?t read books to kill time. Read books to save time.</p><p>When you feel angry, go to bed.

You dont know how smart you truly are until you are financially independent.</p><p>Anything worth creating requires years of struggles.</p><p>Starting over at any age is no big deal if you value the process.</p><p>Rich people wont settle for any investment. Attractive people wont settle for any partner. Talented people wont settle for any work. The more you have, the more patient you get.

Ask why you don?t believe in yourself and need their validation.</p><p>The smarter you get, the less you react to words, and the more you understand them.</p><p>That?s one reason why many start their own business.</p><p>Talking about your own mistakes is a sign of maturity.</p><p>You graduate from weird to interesting once you have results.</p><p>It?s not that easy in practice btw. Most people are blind to the red flags when they are around someone attractive.</p><p>Observation 1: You can instantly know whether someone likes you through eye contact. Observation 2: If someone decides to dislike you, anything you do will be misinterpreted in a negative way. Observation 3: Never waste time with relationships that feel off. Trust your guts.</p><p>Four misconceptions: - eating often makes you healthy (you need to fast) - saving money alone makes you rich (you need to reinvest) - reading self-help books makes you calm (you need to practice mindfulness) - meaningful work alone is sufficient (you need a meaningful family)</p><p>When a book starts great but slowly loses momentum, its because the writer transitions from having something to say, to wanting to say something.</p><p>Who you want to save reflects the old you that wasnt saved.</p><p>I should probably add that not wanting anything doesn?t mean you have nothing.</p><p>Don?t worry, I just block people who don?t think before they react. Nothing personal.</p><p>You are rich when you need no one and want nothing.</p><p>If you?ve never been rejected, you haven?t even started.</p><p>Growing up in poverty teaches you one thing: no one helps you when you actually need help. You get used to the indifference of people. But you will also learn creativity, courage, and self-reliance.</p><p>The problem of too much reading: you start thinking you understand what you don?t.</p><p>Be serious about your work: Have a deadline.</p><p>You attract people like you, so just become who you want around.</p><p>A sign of intelligence: not thinking of people you dislike.</p><p>How you think is more important than what you know.</p><p>Who you want to help reflects your scars.</p><p>A good indicator of self-love: you enjoy spending time with your own mind.</p><p><span>Thank you ! I set up this page, <a href="https://t.co/qlc7L13ge5">https://t.co/qlc7L13ge5</a> for people interested in getting informed by email once it?s finished.

Hopefully, my current draft will satisfy me, but I thought the same thing six months ago, so I?d rather not give any release date haha. The three key words I?m aiming for: original, insightful, fun to read.</p><p>Writing a book takes a lot more time than you think. ??</p><p>You can steal ideas, but you can neither steal execution nor self-esteem.</p><p>Signs of success. - you wake up, go to bed with a smile - you are honest in your words, actions - you are self-driven by noble purposes - you never react cynically - their success stirs no envy - you appreciate simple things - you help freely with no expectation - you have time</p><p>The fear of being criticized gets you criticized. Get out of your mind. Most people will barely remember your name a few years from now. Do what you want to do, not what you think people expect from you.</p><p>If you don?t make a few crazy bets when you?re still young,  you will never earn any self-confidence. Experience coming from unique attempts is invaluable.</p><p>You dont have time to hate the success of anybody when you are busy.</p><p>However smart you think they are, never base an important, personal decision on someone else?s opinion. Even smart people are regularly wrong.</p><p>The more successful you get, the less you care about proving your point.</p><p>Its fine to dislike the way you thought before. It means you are growing.</p><p>The smarter you get, the more you can learn from anyone.</p><p>If you think you are a slow learner, its because you are more focused on the growth of others than your own.</p><p>Listening is smarter than talking. Reading is faster than listening. Writing is deeper than reading. Experiencing is better than writing. Teaching wraps it all. You get mastery.</p><p>What?s your biggest regret so far?</p><p>Your relationship with your parents gets better once you realize they are as fragile and insecure as you are.</p><p>The really rich won?t brag about money. The really gifted won?t brag about skill. The really happy won?t brag about love. The really smart won?t brag at all.</p><p>Competition is fun when you are talented. Competition is dreadful when you are average. Competition is unnecessary when you are unique.</p><p>If you dont think for yourself, you will live the life others thought for you.</p><p>Exactly. Credentials won?t land you the dream life, but they might give you the courage to take more risks and catch unexpected opportunities. The first impression is important, and people always cling onto what they are used to. Plus, visa purpose. It helps to move abroad.</p><p>Interesting people seek interesting people. They share similar traits: - questioning everything - firmly defined values - got off the beaten tracks - top-notch in at least one skill - optimistic, building a better world - value long-term relationships - egoless, good listeners</p><p>What is one thing you wish you knew before you started your career/business?</p><p>One day gets you started. One month gets you results. One year gets you growth. One decade gets you success.</p><p>Writing down your own average thoughts teaches you more than reading great thoughts from others.</p><p>A vicious circle: the more you need money, the more short-term you think, the less money you get, because all the best investments are long-term.</p><p>The higher your self-esteem, the less you seek to impress others.</p><p>Writing is how you understand you didnt understand.</p><p>People who genuinely care about you regardless of what you can do for them are few. Treasure them.</p><p>Maybe you dont need to learn more, maybe you need more clarity in what you already know.</p><p>You want to achieve something meaningful in your lifetime, learn to ignore the distractions.</p><p>What is one concept you notice everywhere once you?ve heard of it once?</p><p>Same here.  Many have a distorted vision of the reality and love because of too much Hollywood, but once you dig deep enough in yourself, you develop a great intuition with people. Doesn?t take more than a few minutes to figure out there?s something off.</p><p>The best relationships are without motivation:  two people who don?t need each other, but choose to enjoy each other?s company.</p><p>The twenties are the best decade to fail. Take risks. Learn as much as you can. No one expected much from you anyway.</p><p>You truly love someone when you want them to be self-reliant.</p><p>There are many many factors involved, but in my case,  I am way more creative today than when I had to worry about saving enough for food and the basic necessities. But one could also argue that the struggles were necessary to become who I am today. The mind is unpredictable.</p><p>You are as creative as your financial safety net allows you to be.</p><p>Good teachers advocate writing. Good doctors advocate fasting. Good thinkers advocate time alone. Good athletes advocate tough training. Good people advocate helping others. Good entrepreneurs advocate creating value. Good mentors advocate all of the above.</p><p>Notice how many successful writers started their career at around 30 or later. Good ideas without depth of experience won?t bloom.</p><p>Observation: Many can?t have a calm conversation leaving ego and emotions aside. They are unaware of their attachment to labels and their self-created identity.  They get defensive upon hearing general criticism. People who care more about learning than being right are rare.</p><p>Smart and confident people like to hang out with smart and confident people. The reason: they can freely speak without the fear of hurting any sensibility.</p><p>You cant be an entrepreneur if you cant handle aloneness.</p><p>If you have no health issue, you are rich. If you have no anger issue, you are wise. If you have no envy issue, you are smart.</p><p>The more you write, the better you think when you read.</p><p><span>Reminds me of: <a href="https://t.co/V3DZ1nOAi0">https://t.co/V3DZ1nOAi0</a></span></p><p>People who never created anything can never truly appreciate the beauty of any creation.</p><p>A long stay abroad in a different culture should be compulsory in the curriculum.</p><p>I also have a hard time imagining who I would be without the Internet.</p><p>Which person/event had the biggest influence on your life? Why?</p><p>You want to stay friends,  don?t involve money. You want to stay lovers, don?t involve others. You want to stay happy, don?t involve ego.</p><p>You never heard about most of the happiest people, and never will.</p><p><span><a href="https://t.co/2VBslFNcPP">https://t.co/2VBslFNcPP</a></span></p><p>10s: you compete for good grades. 20s: you compete for money. 30s: you compete for status. 40s: you get your mid-life crisis. 50s: you realize it was all about family. 60s: you realize it was all about health. 70s: you realize it was all about living with detachment.</p><p>The best relationships involve people who are in love with how their partner thinks.</p><p>Every time you think you figured things out, life will be there to prove you wrong.</p><p>To learn faster,  slow down with the basics.</p><p>You have to pick up two books. One fiction. One non-fiction. You can read nothing else for the next ten years. Which do you choose?</p><p>Relationships are simple when you think before you talk.</p><p>8 guiding principles. - smile - enjoy today - dont be a jerk - you dont have time - honesty under all circumstances - never make unnecessary enemies - if it costs you little, help without second thought - time spent with people you love is never wasted</p><p>I often say, if you have time to complain about life being unfair, you have time to work harder and learn how to use your cards better. And nothing feels better than completing a game in the difficult mode.</p><p>Applicable to: - business / money - family / love - fitness / health - self-esteem / happiness Its also faster to memorize than to re-think things from scratch, but long-term, theres little value in the former.</p><p>Most people who are financially independent earned it with decades of efforts.</p><p>Feeling envy means you are unfocused.</p><p>Everybody has ups and downs. Don?t be too quick to judge.</p><p>Whats the worst habit you unlearnt?</p><p>You also thought it was too late five years ago.</p><p>Smart people read to find flaws in themselves.</p><p>Your best life decisions wont be reached through consensus. Quite the opposite.</p><p>If you are smart, you know how money controls people. If you are mature, you know physical appearance matters. If you are wise, you know silence is invaluable. If you are happy, you know its about the right people.</p><p>More books won?t get you wiser. More food won?t get you healthier. More friends won?t get you happier. Always choose quality over quantity.</p><p>Im not sure why so many people care about people who dont care about them.</p><p>No one respects you when you show no result. Dont seek respect, seek results.</p><p>Benefits of writing every day for several years: - concision, eloquence - better memory - self-confidence - fluency if foreign language - being calm, mindful - being imaginative, compelling - deeper self-understanding - upon rereading, noticing your growth - legacy for your kids</p><p>I think they tend to be published. People with a great story wont let it die that easily. They just take the shape of fiction, with a few tweaks here and there.</p><p>Every single interesting person out there has a very complicated past.</p><p>This was my plan for 2020-2021 but it kinda got compromised.</p><p>When you speak, dont focus on speed, focus on depth. There is no one to impress. Taking the time to think saves you lots of trouble.</p><p>People respect you once you respect yourself. You respect yourself if you implement healthy habits and strive for growth.</p><p>Agreed. It attracts interesting, ambitious people, it?s safe, clean, most people are well-educated / respectful / kind, food is great, public transport works, hospitals/infrastructures are great, weather too. You need to speak Japanese fluently to fully appreciate though.</p><p>You are financially free. Which city do you choose to live in? Why?</p><p>Fall in love with competing with yourself.</p><p>Funny how life helps you once you help people.</p><p>It?s easier to make friends when you already have friends. It?s easier to make money when you already have money. It?s easier to get into a relationship when you have already been into one. It?s easier to get a job when you already have a job. The reason: self-confidence.</p><p>Maybe you are not antisocial, maybe you just need smarter people around you.</p><p>The less you need them, the more they get interested in you. Self-reliance is attractive.</p><p>The best thing you can do when you are angry is nothing.</p><p>Provide value for free. You gain trust.</p><p>Observation: The less talented they are, the more it seems to hurt them to compliment someone else.</p><p>I have yet to meet a smart person without a good sense of humor.</p><p>It?s irrational to expect rationality from people.</p><p>If you knew how many hours good public speakers spent, on reading, writing, thinking, teaching, exchanging ideas, you wouldnt say eloquence is a talent. Its mostly hard work and discipline.</p><p>Not having to wake up to an alarm is the best thing money can buy.</p><p>That?s why living abroad, surrounded by very different people, is so important imo. And i mean years of blending in and getting fluent in the local language, not tourism. Culture shock is just a buzz word for ?readjusting your (formerly wrong) view of the world.?</p><p>What did you completely change your mind about whilst growing older? Your biggest ?wow, I was wrong? ?</p><p>The best school gives you time to think. The best job gives you time to learn. The best life gives you time to grow.</p><p>It?s less about what you read, and more about how you think whilst reading.</p><p>Perks of growing up poor: 1) You have few desires: consumption is a habit. 2) You are not gullible: you know how the needy manipulate each other. 3) You are creative: especially when it comes to make each dollar count. 4) You are grateful: you know what you are lucky to have.</p><p>I?m no master anyway ?? Proof: I block people on Twitter all the time,  because I read every single message, and I want to keep my feed clean with respectful, happy people.</p><p>Beginner: argue. Intermediate: prove them wrong. Advanced: smile, leave, forget. Master: be indifferent.</p><p>For those wondering: Schools are about keeping kids busy. Offices are about keeping adults busy. Churches are about keeping the rest busy. Restaurants are about filling up the remaining time. You?re welcome.</p><p>Most successful people are humble. They assume they can learn from you, and will listen with non-judgmental ears. Many struggling people are arrogant. They assume they have nothing to learn from you, and that you are the arrogant one. Causation / correlation, not sure.</p><p>Observations. 1) People tend to treat you less seriously when you look young. 2) People who talk the most tend to be the less interesting. 3) You are suddenly attractive when you are in a happy relationship. 4) People who don?t need external advice humbly listen and learn.</p><p>Life is short. Only fools waste time arguing.</p><p>The smartest people are full-time investors in their own mind.</p><p>Avoid unnecessary debt. Avoid unnecessary food. Avoid unnecessary drugs. Avoid unnecessary people. Avoid unnecessary thoughts. Avoid unnecessary reactions. Avoid unnecessary emotions. Avoid unnecessary conversations. You are smart when you understand what is truly necessary.</p><p>There is no love at first sight. You are just infatuated to an image, a sample of the visual ideal you were conditioned with, through Hollywood, through marketing. It takes years to understand oneself. It takes even longer to understand someone else. Dont be blind.</p><p>On nest jamais mieux servi que par soi-mˆme.</p><p>Imo, the ideal education system is not scalable. Too many private schools just end up becoming lucrative businesses as they get bigger.</p><p>Smart kids who get their potential inhibited. Growing up in a poor neighborhood. Clueless parents. They will ace all their classes until high school included. They will not learn how to actually focus and make efforts. Then, they will realize the gap with the best.</p><p>Academic aspect: it depends. Most people, by definition, went to average schools, with average teachers. Homeschooling would have been better only with smart parents. But smart parents would have chosen better schools to begin with. The bad recurrent scenario:</p><p>Weighing in: it depends. On the social aspect, if you are different from the other kids, background, ethnicity, wits, you are going to have a hard time. More likely to get bullied than get friends. Net positive though: you get a good grasp on human nature faster.</p><p>What was your experience of school? Did the positive weight out the negative? Would you consider homeschooling for your kids?</p><p>Growth starts when being embarrassed is no longer a big deal.</p><p>Stay away from people who can?t appreciate anything. It?s contagious.</p><p>The more you have, wealth, wits, love, the more you want to keep a low profile.</p><p>Fastest way to get things done: remove all distractions, get bored, do.</p><p>Id like to add: both physically and intellectually, most people can change way more than they think. But it might take something like one decade.</p><p>You want a well-balanced vision, experience the extrema. Be poor, then rich. Be weak, then strong. Be reactive, then calm. Be unhappy, then happy. Be insecure, then confident. Be plain, then good-looking. Be alone, then with great people. Be ignorant, then knowledgeable.</p><p>You think more clearly once you desire less. The clearest thinkers have everything they want.</p><p>A peaceful morning. A great novel. Your limitless imagination. This is also happiness.</p><p>Never tolerate someone who doesn?t respect your time. That?s a sign of self-love.</p><p>Signs of growth: 1) Every time you look back on who you were, you cringe. 2) Many of your friends changed throughout the years. 3) You no longer jump to conclusions. You notice your ego. 4) You seek to understand your parents. 5) You are no longer scared of being disliked.</p><p>It takes intelligence to not react when unnecessary. Calm people are smart people.</p><p>Creativity has nothing to do with working long hours.</p><p>If they are younger than you, and more successful, be it in love, finance, intellect, then you should learn from them, maybe even invest in them, not be jealous and resentful.</p><p>The best relationships are formed between people who dont need each other.</p><p>Insecure people attack you on your weaknesses. They want you at their level, down there. Successful people stimulate you on your strengths. They want you at their level, up there.</p><p>You are back in 
You have 30 seconds to write a note to yourself. Given your current knowledge and wisdom, what advice do you give?</p><p>To solve money issues: - learn to create - learn to sell - learn to invest To solve relationship issues: - learn to kindly listen - learn to control your ego - learn to be mindful, unreactive To solve creativity issues: - learn to meditate - learn to relax - learn to focus</p><p>You are rich when you are creative.</p><p>Smart people appreciate silence.</p><p>I think the best long-term plans are a mix of: - knowledge - intuition - talent To be rebalanced according to your circumstances.</p><p>Its never going to be perfect. Have a deadline. Deliver.</p><p>Never assume people have time for you, and always show appreciation to those who offer you theirs.</p><p>Similarly, ?not all those who wander are lost.? It?s like a puzzle. On average, methodical people solve many more of them, although they don?t get to decide the solving steps precisely. ?I?m not sure? is fairly different from ?I have no idea what I am doing.?</p><p>Don?t drop out of college without a plan. Don?t quit your job without a plan. Don?t get married without a plan. Don?t go abroad without a plan. A few might get lucky. But most successful people had a plan.</p><p>A great decision for many of us.</p><p>What is your best life decision so far?</p><p>When you are smart, but ignorant, you end up cynical. When you are smart, but unloved, you end up angry. When you are smart, but surrounded by fools, you end up paranoid. When you are smart, knowledgeable, loved, and surrounded by smart people, you end up happy.</p><p>Never totally let go of your momentum. It can take years to build it again.</p><p>There was this game called The Sims. Your characters would behave completely irrationally if you didn?t upgrade their points in intelligence. It?s inspired from real life.</p><p>Never envy people with a deep understanding of human nature. You don?t know how much nonsense they had to go through.</p><p>What is your ideal job, that you would do for free if money wasn?t an issue?</p><p>History was not supposed to be boring. Mathematics was not supposed to be stressful. Philosophy was not supposed to be detached from reality. Forget about any bad impression left by school. Start over at any age. Learning isnt a competition. You succeed if you get smarter.</p><p>Being able to focus every day on a discipline you love is a privilege. It is also commonly called happiness.</p><p>The best investment you can make: building a clear mind capable of learning anything. Study history for the big picture. Study the hard subjects to train your mental muscles. The dots will magically connect.</p><p>The most common ally of successful entrepreneurs: family. The most common enemy of failed entrepreneurs: family.</p><p>Interesting people all started weird.</p><p>You can learn about what kind of spouse/parent you dont want to become, and avoid the path theyve taken.</p><p>To be trusted, speak clearly. To speak clearly, think clearly. To think clearly, write every day.</p><p>Most people underestimate what they can learn from their parents, in their presence and in their absence.</p><p>Focused efforts, an antidote for anxiety. Meaningful work, an antidote for depression. Healthy relationships, an antidote for loneliness. Mindfulness, an antidote for anger. Curiosity, an antidote for boredom. Risk-taking, an antidote for insecurities.</p><p>Learning starts with freedom. The freedom to read slowly. The freedom to teach slowly. The freedom to connect the dots slowly. This isn?t school anymore. Stop seeking speed.</p><p>I have a similar definition. The more successful you are, the less envy you feel. Because success requires the understanding of your own desires.</p><p>When do you consider yourself successful?</p><p>If you truly want freedom, you will figure out a path towards entrepreneurship.</p><p>It takes a few years to build trust. It takes a few seconds to destroy it.</p><p>Unless you enjoy living with regrets, never talk when you feel angry, never act when you feel angry. Get a good night of sleep instead.</p><p>I have seen some of the loveliest people out there,  giving without second thought for several decades, only to get backstabbed whenever they?d show any weakness. Nothing feels more meaningful than mutual respect and trust. But we need to make space for the right people.</p><p>If you think everyone is grateful when you help them, you are wrong. Invest in the right people or waste some life.</p><p>The best relationships teach you trust. The worst relationships teach you detachment.</p><p>Hope you?re doing okay now. ?? Focusing on a creative hobby seems to be a healthy way to cope with hardships. I?m pretty sure the most creative people are all mentally struggling to keep a clear mind.</p><p>Took a while to unlearn my conditioning. Anger doesn?t vanish overnight, even in a new environment. Financial stress takes a toll on your mental health. Clarity and confidence need time to get built. Trustworthy, smart friends are rare. Just believe that better days will come.</p><p>Chiming in: Feeling worthless, untrustworthy for decades was the worst. Started at 6, bullied, mocked as a minority. Anger, mistrust, anxiety piling up. Immigrant parents struggling. Poverty leading to stress, arguments. Then scholarship abroad. A few people believing in me.</p><p>What was the worst period of your life, and how did you overcome it?</p><p>Very well stated. I couldn?t agree more on the personality part.</p><p>If you constantly need someone to tell you what to study and what to do, you are already failing. Successful people are all self-driven. Take initiative. Consistently deliver.</p><p>When it comes to interesting people, it?s less about the books they?ve read, and more about the people they?ve met, and the traumas they?ve overcome.</p><p>You can skip high school, read little, and lead a successful life. You can have a PhD, read a lot, and have little common sense. The Internet opened up a new era, where credentials matter less, where creativity is rewarded more. Being different is no longer shunned.</p><p>People in their twenties lack patience. They get into the first relationship that feels okay. They invest in the first asset that feels okay. They accept any job that feels okay. Raise your standards. Allow yourself to waste time exploring. You might save decades.</p><p>It?s never too late to reach a near-native level imo, people just tend to have other priorities as they get older, it doesn?t mean it can?t be done.</p><p>What do you wish you had learnt earlier?</p><p>If you have time to worry, you have time to make the situation better.</p><p>It depends on your character, and your overall presence, but when it comes to trust: most people, often unawarely, do not open up. They are scared of getting hurt. Wont talk about their insecurities and weaknesses. You cant expect the other party to open up in that case.</p><p>Read to learn, not to disagree.</p><p>Know yourself, know others. Then, follow your intuition.</p><p>Invest in the right people early. You will never feel lonely.</p><p>As always, it depends on many external factors, but the happiest old people i know have kids. It?s one component of a much bigger equation.</p><p>15, you worry about grades.18, you worry about university.22, you worry about the right job.25, you worry about the right partner.35, you worry about your kids.45, you worry about your parents.55, you worry about your kids, again.65, you worry about health. Stop worrying.</p><p>Life doesn?t care about your plans.</p><p>Whats the most important thing youve learnt from your parents?</p><p>If you are happy, you won?t waste time convincing anyone you are happy.</p><p>Half of happiness is about getting rid of relationships you dont need. You will get peace. The other half is about creating something you and others need. You will get meaning.</p><p>Handwritten letters are underrated. They pack up far more meaning. Reading a 10-year-old letter from someone you love is a priceless experience.</p><p>Yeah it does. I think its a compulsory step. Its just that sooner or later, you realize you can spend decades learning full-time from all the brightest minds out there but theres an opportunity cost in expressing yourself. The real fun. So, you decide when thats enough.</p><p>I talk to people with a different thought process / experiences, but with fundamental similar values. I also have some time allocated to doing literally nothing. I found it quite efficient. In the past, I used to be constantly in need of stimulation ? books, podcasts, etc. ?</p><p>Some days will define decades of your life. Up to your good judgment to even recognize these days.</p><p>Financial success is often about being liked by the right few people.</p><p>People seem to dislike you when you do things differently yet get better results.</p><p>The most common cause of ?wasting your twenties.? 1) Being scared of wasting them. 2) Taking the safer path of being validated. 3) Realizing in your thirties/forties you were wrong.</p><p>When you lower your standards, you also lower your self-esteem.</p><p>Things I will no longer take for granted. - walking outside freely - working out at the gym - working in coffee shops - traveling abroad - economic, political stability - importance of emergency fund - busy, meaningful days - the privilege of long-term thinking - peace of mind</p><p>Some of the wisest people I know read very few books (though they used to read a lot in their childhood) Also met the opposite, avid readers with no common sense. There are a lot of components involved.</p><p>Its not about the books youve read, its about how its all connected in your mind.</p><p>You don?t need to feel guilty about being less productive. We are just too conditioned to be constantly busy running. Use the opportunity to reconnect with the people you forgot you loved. Including yourself.</p><p>The key is to figure out how to focus even when your routine and good habits are disrupted.</p><p>Well said.</p><p>I?m sure she loves you.</p><p>Not sure about the last one ??</p><p>What have you learnt about yourself during this quarantine?</p><p>It is possible to read something you disagree with without reacting.</p><p>If you haven?t, you won?t stay rich for long.</p><p>If you are poor, you should value your time even more, not mindlessly consume what you dont need.</p><p>You are not smart just because you graduated. You are not in love just because you are in a relationship. You are not attractive just because you have a pretty face. You are not successful just because you are rich. You are not wise just because you read. It takes much more.</p><p>Mindless practice is time wasted. Mindful practice is happy time.</p><p>Independent thinkers will always feel out of place in a classroom setting.</p><p>On Twitter, block early, block often. In real life, figure out how to be financially independent.</p><p>Exactly. I think many people don?t value their time, and they end up projecting themselves. It?s a matter of respect to not waste someone else?s time with trivialities. You will free time for the meaningful questions and valuable conversations.</p><p>If you have time to pay attention to human stupidity, you have time to improve your own intelligence.</p><p>At any time of your life, you should have a hobby reminding you of what it?s like to be a beginner.</p><p>Dont waste money. Dont waste energy. Dont waste time. Just because you can afford it doesnt mean you should.</p><p>The best feeling in the world: long-term efforts paying off.</p><p>No one cares about your opinion unless you showed results.</p><p>Never ask a question you could have googled.</p><p>Exactly. Of course, smarter people are likely busy. They will interact with you directly once you have value to offer. Life is also full of learning opportunities. People are just too constrained by their mental limits. Explore the unknown. No one will tell you what that is.</p><p>Study the habits of the best. Change early, change often. Surround yourself with smarter than you. Read timeless books, not business books. When you feel an opportunity interrupt whatever you are doing. They are rare. Go all in. Focus, execute. Doubts are part of the road.</p><p>Now is a good time to figure out who truly cares about you.</p><p>Starting a long journey in a country where I didn?t even speak the language. Investing money I couldn?t afford to lose. Asking someone out of my league out. Surgery after a near-death experience. Changing my relationship with my parents. Life seems to reward courage.</p><p>The best decisions of your life always feel a bit scary.</p><p>The best romantic relationships: - have a great start - only get better with time - feel effortless all throughout - are based on trust and respect - involve people not scared of time alone - involve people who grow - require love  friendship - require commitment  integrity</p><p>You shouldnt have time to argue with Internet strangers.</p><p>Some speeches became compulsory readings. You and your research, Dr. Richard W. Hamming. This is water, David Foster Wallace. Stay hungry, stay foolish, Steve Jobs. Anything else similar you love?</p><p>The best financial advice come from people who no longer need to work.</p><p>I think a lot of this conditioning stems from the structure of school. You are incentivized to memorize fast, with a short time horizon, frequent exams, and because of the opportunity cost, you get used to not exploring the unknown / taking risks.</p><p>Let good investments compound. You become rich. Let smart efforts compound. You become successful. Let good relationships compound. You become happy. Time is an ally when you are wise.</p><p>It will be included in the book I hope to finish this year. In a surprise format. ??</p><p>You want to receive more, just give more.</p><p>When should you start teaching kids about money? What makes a person self-confident? Where would you choose to be reborn, given your current knowledge of the past decades? What makes a healthy relationship? Pretty random, really. ??  Just follow your interests! ??</p><p>Many people will feel entitled to your time. You should feel free to ignore them. Life is too short to build relationships with people you dislike.</p><p>3-4 times a week in another format: I have a language exchange partner, I write in my native language + my foreign language(s), she does the same, and we fix each others mistakes. We come up with new questions together once in a while.</p><p>Its part of the exercise. Look around: you, people, society, life, and start connecting the dots.</p><p>A healthy habit: Come up with a thought-provoking question, and write a short essay about it, everyday. Any topic is fine. Follow personal interests.</p><p>I actually write like I talk to my mom.</p><p>Not enough people understand money, and almost no one follows it.</p><p>Yeah, I mostly point out the structure that incentivizes rote memorization and conformity of thoughts over self-exploration guided by curiosity. I know teachers have no choice but follow some guidelines and educational programs to get their accreditation.</p><p>The general public wrongly believes: - the media care about the truth - the law cares about justice - governments care about people - banks care about integrity - schools care about education - organizations care about public health - companies care about your happiness</p><p>Things you want to avoid. 1) reading without thinking2) consuming without creating3) doing without understanding4) theory without practice5) marriage without love6) money without meaning7) living without mindfulness8) efforts without results9) family without trust</p><p>You need both. When its time to get things done, you sprint. When its time to let ideas mature, you stay patient. If you strike the right balance, you get results.</p><p>There is no creativity without relaxed, free time.</p><p>Higher education was not supposed to destroy common sense.</p><p>Been discussing with a few friends: after this crisis, bright, international profiles with professional optionality, will definitely be settled when it comes to where to not settle.</p><p>Talent is just long-term great habits.</p><p>Write everyday for ten years. Code everyday for ten years. Do what it is you love everyday, for ten years. If you don?t practice your discipline everyday, you don?t love it, period. Don?t fall in love with the idea of doing. Fall in love with the doing.</p><p>What are some underrated, original movies you love? Three picks: - Waking life (2001) - The Man from Earth (2007) - Frequencies (2013)</p><p>People think they want money. They actually want freedom. Dont be rich and enslaved.</p><p>Self-education is the best education, because you learn at your own pace, because books have infinite patience, because no insecure teacher will break your confidence, because you get to study what truly interests you, because its fun to learn freely for free.</p><p>If you truly want to do something, you will find a way to do it, as imperfect as it might be at first.</p><p>Work hard. Luck becomes your edge. Never lie. Clarity becomes your edge. Imagine, create. Precognition becomes your edge. Stand alone. Courage becomes your edge.</p><p>99%+ of the population doesnt even know you exist. Try to live without caring about reputation. You might start living the life you truly want.</p><p>Its also the secret of a healthy relationship with yourself, leading to healthy relationships with others. Imo, you can never find meaningful love if you havent found self-love first.</p><ul><li>education: neglects mathematics <!-- -->/ physics <!-- -->/ philosophy <!-- -->/ history. learns to solve problems without any grasp of the big picture. seeks validation rather than truth and understanding. - music: cant read sheets. little technique. only learnt a few songs to impress others. etc.</li></ul><p>
Some examples. - foreign languages: little effort on the pronunciation / pitch-accent / grammar. thinks its just about cramming vocabulary. - martial arts / weight training: neglects proper form. tries to impress by being fast, lifting too much. often hurt themselves.</p><p>The less talented they are, the more they look down on the basics.</p><p>It?s precisely valuable because it?s hard.</p><p>People who achieve an overnight success in their thirties started to fail at eighteen.</p><p>If you dont believe in your own growth, no one has time to try to convince you.</p><p>Signs of clear thinking. 1) You are emotionally detached. 2) You dont live in your mind. 3) Mindfulness is just another habit. 4) Reading and writing are routines. 5) You are creative, happy. 6) You arent scared of taking initiative. 7) You value time alone, silence.</p><p>Exactly. Often, when you ask someone what theyve learnt from a book, they struggle to remember. I need to read it again. It means they never stopped during the reading, to reflect, to see how the knowledge applied to their lives.</p><p>Anyone can criticize. It?s easy. What is harder: bringing value to the table, improving things through actions, making a positive impact in many lives.</p><p>The value of a book depends less on the writer and more on your own mind.</p><p>Unintelligent people care less about what you say, and more about how you say it. Smart people do the opposite.</p><p>Long-term, you attract exactly the people you deserve.</p><p>1) When you feel happy and calm,  write and publish. 2) When you feel angry and depressed, write but don?t publish. 2) leads to 1).</p><p>Some people will get offended by everything you say. Some people will dig a logical fallacy out of everything you say. Some people will never truly listen to what you say. Thats fine. Cut off. Move on. The world is full of kind, respectful, smart people. No need to endure.</p><p>Me too. Its no big deal, but few people execute. You see your parents argue all the time, over money, habits, chores, over being insensitive, disrespectful, you learn. You disliked seeing a parent acting a certain way, you do the opposite when its your turn.</p><p>Growing up in a dysfunctional family can teach you how to be a great spouse and a great parent. Growing up with little financial opportunities can teach you how to make the most of each dollar. Growing up anxious can teach you the value of calmness and clarity. All up to you.</p><p>Who needs movies when you can just watch reality.</p><p>Hard to understand the rich if youve never been rich. Hard to understand the poor if youve never been poor. To understand money better, experience both.</p><p>Bullish for the next few decades. - new content creation - self-education - #Bitcoin  - learning, unlearning, fast - coding - online games, VR - individual character - foreign languages - mathematics, philosophy - social media - remote work - well-being - homeschooling - books</p><p>No one will like you if you dont like yourself.</p><p>The smarter you get, the more you appreciate silence: your mind is enough of a stimulation.</p><p>Forget about what you can no longer do. Focus on what you can still do. Fasting, thinking. Meditating in silence. A few push-ups and squats. Taking care of your beloved. Self-reflection through writing. Reading novels you had put aside. Enjoying another day in a healthy body.</p><p>Feel free to start your own account. I block rude people btw.</p><p>Without imagination, you won?t enjoy any great novel. Without commitment, you won?t enjoy any great relationship. Without patience, you won?t enjoy any great success. Without gratitude, you won?t enjoy any peace. Without slowing down, you won?t enjoy any great life.</p><p>Time is priceless. Health is priceless. A clear mind is priceless. Loyal friends are priceless. A loving family is priceless. None of these can be bought.</p><p>A friend of mine who spent most of his life in Japan, Hong Kong, and England, always puts it that way: Whenever I go back to the West, it feels like traveling in time, back to the past.</p><p>I think it depends on people, yeah. I just appreciate the silence of a blank page, it feels like I can dig deeper in my own thoughts, but I guess talking to yourself whilst recording will also teach you a lot about yourself. In the end, its about doing it consistently.</p><p>When you feel anxious, write. When you feel angry, write. When you feel down, write. Writing allows you to observe yourself objectively. Unneeded emotions are released during the process.</p><p>When you think the whole world revolves around you, when you take general criticism as personal attacks, when, because you constantly judge others, you think everybody else does it too, when you dont open up because you are scared, and often, hurt others before they hurt you.</p><p>The best indicators of unhappiness: - nitpicking - cynicism - defensiveness - anger over trivial matters -&amp;gt; gets ignored by all The best indicators of happiness: - seeking to understand others - spontaneous smiles - trust people - high energy - calmness -&amp;gt; attracts good people</p><p>Smart people all share similar traits:  they write  read since early childhood, they love imagining stories  the future, they aren?t scared of exchanging ideas, they seek to challenge themselves. No special talent here. Just curiosity compounding over time.</p><p>You dont need to be highly smart and knowledgeable to be respected. You just need to be consistently honest.</p><p>Things to do as a student. 1) Study abroad. At least one year. Might be worth more than all your classes. 2) Perfect your English. Concision and clarity are assets. 3) Meet people. Understand their perspective. 4) Be patient. Think one decade of efforts before results.</p><p>The secret of any great relationship: two mindful people who care about providing value when they speak.

Consider it a spiritual retreat, the opportunity to sharpen creativity and to understand your mind better.</p><p>Nothing worse than ignorance with a big ego. ?Do not tell me what to do? causes immense damage. In times of urgency, the educated, who never stopped learning, have no time to teach from scratch those enslaved by entertainment till recently. The best the latter can do: listen.</p><p>Times of crisis. Some relationships will break apart. Some relationships will grow stronger. As the survival instinct resurfaces, masks fall, lies disappear. You get to see people as they truly are.</p><p>7) They are being patient and empathetic with everyone, whilst knowing many people are vultures waiting for a moment of weakness to say, ?well, told you!? 8) They are pressured by expectations from everyone. They know they don?t owe anyone anything, but it?s still exhausting.</p><p>4) They get ad hominem attacks because people can?t discuss ideas whilst leaving aside ego. 5) Many people they help, (a) rarely express gratitude, only criticism. (b) blame them with illogical thinking. 6) They constantly have to wonder whether they are the crazy, stupid ones.</p><p>Reasons why smart people end up angry. 1) They need to take responsibility for the irresponsible. 2) They are often blamed for their one mistake, and ignored for their hundred good deeds. 3) They are targeted by the insecure who are offended upon not getting attention.</p><p>Good things take much longer than you think. Bad things happen much faster than you think.</p><p>If you are healthy with a mind capable of learning, you still have your most important asset.</p><p>I have always advocated time alone. It purifies thoughts. It enhances creativity. You get rid of emotional baggage. And now, it can even save lives.</p><p>Blaise Pascal on the coronavirus: ?All of humanity?s problems stem from man?s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.?</p><p>Anger is not attractive. Calmness backed by real strength is.</p><p>2020 is your reminder, that no matter your long-term efforts, your vision and your mental models, your good habits and your clarity of mind, life never happens according to plan.</p><p>Smart people waste little time arguing, because they know a few hours of talking can?t replace years of real education.</p><p>Smart people don?t spend their time rehearsing bad memories.</p><p>Feel free to love yourself.</p><p>You are rich when you are healthy. You are poor when you are greedy. You are happy when you are loved.</p><p>There is no empathy without calmness. If you cant see deeply in your own being, there is no way you can see clearly in anyone elses.</p><p>Any word inevitably gets misunderstood. Especially, some people seem to believe: - empathy = being an emotional rollercoaster - empathy = overthinking everything - empathy = lots of self-talk  reminiscing past events related to others Thats called living in your mind.</p><p>To get rich, invest in undervalued people.</p><p>It tends to be self-regulating. You get screwed a few times, you learn to focus only on people who are worth it.</p><p>Empathy is underrated. It makes you a better writer. It makes you a better investor. It makes you a better entrepreneur. It makes you a better spouse, a better parent. It makes you a better daughter, a better son. It makes you a better friend. Use it well, get a better life.</p><p>Your dumbest, impulsive reactions are also your most memorable life lessons.</p><p>If you think ten years of efforts is long, you are not focused enough.</p><p>When a conversation flows seamlessly from one topic to another, when your partner knows what you mean even before you say it, when it?s a pure exchange of ideas, because both sides are mature enough to leave aside ego and insecurities. That?s when you found a lifelong friend.</p><p>A bunch of people start all their sentences with ?but...? almost mechanically. They subconsciously close themselves to any suggestion and aren?t really listening. Forget about them. They aren?t really trying to change. They are just signaling the desire to be different.</p><p>Consistent practice of mindfulness. Broaden your views by listening more and by being less defensive. Befriend a highly diverse group of minds from all ages and all backgrounds. Remind yourself that your mental models today are likely wrong, and the goal is to be less wrong.</p><p>I usually give up because that?s not worth the time spent. They can?t help but attack you ad hominem, because they perceive any general criticism as a personal attack, and they can?t think clearly, logically. That?s why I write a book btw. You can?t help everyone individually.</p><p>The problem with insecure people: when you try to help them, they think you look down on them, because that?s what they are doing with people even more insecure. Self-projection and ego, the reasons why the average stay average.</p><p>If you have no interesting friends, it?s because you are not an interesting friend. Once you have value to offer, you attract them by dozens. Self-questioning is the beginning of meaningful relationships.</p><p>Choose what makes you enjoy the process.</p><p>If you have a lot on your mind, write. It?s meditation. It?s thought purification. It?s self-guidance. And it?s the habit of all clear thinkers.</p><p>There is no end to just reading a lot. Anyone can read and fool themselves, into thinking they are productive, into thinking they are learning. Deep knowledge acquisition requires skin in the game  application. Experiencing &amp;gt; Writing &amp;gt; Reading Words can only convey so much.</p><p>Half of success is about avoiding mistakes. Avoid debt. Avoid stress. Avoid being a jerk. Avoid lack of sleep. Avoid gaining weight. Avoid insecure people. Avoid reacting to stupidity. Avoid mindless consuming. Avoid staying indoors all day. Avoid getting insulin resistant. etc.</p><p>Wealth is about a lot of free time in a healthy body around your beloved.</p><p>You usually need to start it as a side hustle, no secret here. Your own judgment when it comes to when to quit and go full-time.</p><p>As an immigrant myself (not in the US though,) I think facing these struggles gives you the mental strength and drive to see far beyond what you are being told to look. Add some discrimination and disdain, and your mind gets antifragile, and your values get strongly refined.</p><p>I rely on intuition for many of my decisions, in my private life included. No model can take into account the importance of luck and all the potential black swan events anyway.</p><p>It depends, up to everyone to self-assess their own talents in the context of what the evolving society might need a few years from now. There should be some minimal results within months though, or at least, the long-term vision and direction should feel more and more ?right.?</p><p>Yeah, I think anyone imaginative, disciplined, driven, with character, can go a long way in five years. Some do it in less time even in a foreign country despite the language barrier. Unfortunately, many visualize failure instead of success, and focus on money instead of value.</p><p>?I have an idea, but someone smarter, more talented than me is probably already working on it.? Well, they are likely busy working on something else already. There is less competition than you think. Most give up within six months. Start. Stick to it for at least five years.</p><p>You discover your true friends on your way down, but thats equally true on your way up: some grow distant because they didnt get the free lunch they expected, some no longer offer their assistance because they feel overshadowed. Relationships cant thrive with insecurities.</p><p>You are obsessed by politics when you lack the creativity to come up with anything valuable.</p><p>Its a little bit like attractiveness, and being fit, and well-dressed. Certainly, it wont compensate for an obnoxious personality. But given all other factors equal, they make a tremendous difference throughout the span of a lifetime (works a bit like compound interest.)</p><p>Thank you !  People like to help younger people who remind them of themselves. That?s why karma works: I personally abhor any sign of disrespect, any manipulation, or any form of bullying, and I silently cut off these people, who have no idea they just missed an opportunity.</p><p>They usually have a good eye when it comes to investing in the right people, that?s how they got there. Again, the most difficult step is going from zero to one. Most people conform. Want book recommendations and advice. You need the courage to explore the unknown by yourself.</p><p>Great point. You need to be able to provide something valuable in return. I think many successful people seek: (1) a very different point of view (be completely out of the beaten tracks) (2) youth combined with sparkling eyes, drive, a lot of ?weird? initiatives (potential)</p><p>Higher education is worth it. You just need better judgment regarding, what to study, where to study, how much the degree, and the brand / network, are worth. Many will blame others for their wrong decisions. The mindset of a loser. Know your talents, take responsibility.</p><p>5) ?I wish I had wasted less time with people not worth it.? 6) ?I wish I had traveled earlier and more.? 7) ?I wish I had taken more care of my body.? 8) ?I wish I had stayed true to my values instead of living for others.? 9) ?I wish I had been bolder.? Anything else?</p><p>Regrets heard from old people. 1) ?I wish I had been less worried about most trivial stuff.? 2) ?I wish I had known my parents better.? 3) ?I wish I had had more curiosity, to educate myself and seize opportunities.? 4) ?I wish I had married someone I truly loved.?</p><p>Growth is simple. You surround yourself with people more talented than you. You listen and learn from them. You apply when applicable. That?s it. Most average people won?t do it because of their above average ego.</p><p>From experience, people who hesitate before they talk (because they care about whether they create value,) are actually the ones worth listening to. If you can be helpful to even one person out there, it?s enough of a reason to write already. ??</p><p>Creativity is a muscle. You don?t use it, it atrophies. You use it everyday, you get happy.</p><p>Sit down and start typing anything you can think of. It?s probably crap at the beginning.  That?s fine. You slowly figure out throughout the months and years what you like to write about most. And don?t worry, no one is qualified. ??</p><p>Writing on Twitter is underrated. Make it a routine. You get concise, eloquent, confident. Scared of haters? Write anonymously. Blocking is free. You don?t owe anyone your attention. Ignore the noise. Leave your DM open. Connect with the interesting. Befriend the like-minded.</p><p>Anyone healthy, confident, fit, happy is attractive. To be healthy, sleep well, eat well. To be confident, make more efforts, grow your talents. To be fit, hit the gym, fast regularly. To be happy, stay mindful, connect with kind, honest, driven people, keep learning.</p><p>I?m wary of the unconfident who never got hit on. What happens when someone much smarter and good-looking than your current partner starts flirting? Loyalty is an asset mostly owned by the self-confident, who are used to optionality, who take responsibility for their choices.</p><p>Two people who can?t handle aloneness can never make a happy couple. Many end up staying together as a habit, not because they are truly thrilled by each other anymore. The best relationships are made out of minds striving for personal growth, not out of convenience.</p><p>Growth starts when you realize no one cares about you and your mistakes.</p><p>You learn more about yourself from losing money than from making money.</p><p>Happy people are growing people. Common traits: 1) Criticize themselves rather than others 2) Take responsibility rather than blame 3) Show initiative, create momentum 4) Take measured risks consistently 5) Low ego, listen to the more successful 6) Not dispirited when fail</p><p>It?s true when they finally figured out how to be happy, then they will seek to help out other similar people. But overall, meet a big enough number of people, and you notice how the happy and successful are the most likely to help out without expecting anything in return.</p><p>Everybody loves giving advice. Even the most average people. The secret of filtering out value from noise: learn only from the best. Relationships? They better have a loving family. Fitness? They better be healthy and athletic. Money? They better be financially independent.</p><p>Far less time would be wasted, if 18-year-old kids were pondering, how can I provide value to society, and what should I learn for that? instead of  how do I get a high-paying job, and what credentials do I need for that?</p><p>To be the 1%, avoid what the 99% do.</p><p>Might sound clich‚, but that would be the love for my parents,  who escaped a country in war, started over from scratch,  and pretty much sacrificed their lives to give me the chance they didn?t have. Just wanted to give back as soon as possible while they were not too old.</p><p><span>Related: <a href="https://t.co/WUKur6mBjp">https://t.co/WUKur6mBjp</a> Escaping (relative) poverty is hard. It requires luck, efforts, talent, risk-taking. If there was a well-known recipe, the opportunity would already be gone. Everyone has their own battle based on their own circumstances.</span></p><p>The end goal of working out is health. The end goal of money is freedom. The end goal of creating is to help people. The end goal of education is to be happy. Easy to forget why you started your efforts. Never lose sight of the big picture.</p><p>The problem with many young people, they never experienced war, they have yet to be parent, they don?t notice they were brainwashed by money, they only know comfort, they have no discipline, no imagination, and yet, they are convinced to understand everything and everyone.</p><p>Money doesnt buy happiness directly, but it certainly helps to be able, to travel and open up your mind, to not worry about food, rent, bills, to go to higher-end social events, to be able to take entrepreneurial risks, to cut off relationships you dont need, to relax.</p><p>Start a company even if you are not the best innovator. Write a book even if you are not the best thinker. Invest money even if you are not the most knowledgeable. Live abroad even if you dont speak the language. No struggle, no growth. Dare to fail.</p><p>Poor people like to pretend they?re richer than they are. Rich people like to pretend they?re poorer than they are. Everyone likes to pretend they?re happier than they are.</p><p>Falling in love with reading makes you wise. Falling in love with writing makes you smart. Falling in love with money makes you stupid. Falling in love with drugs kills you faster. Falling in love with efforts makes you talented. Falling in love with people makes you happy.</p><p><span><a href="https://t.co/qlc7L13ge5">https://t.co/qlc7L13ge5</a> I wont send anything until my book is ready to be published though. ??</span></p><p>I actually love movies, especially science-fiction. I ended up watching pretty much all of them. I switched to reading a lot more. The long-term benefits of reading are way superior imo. Freedom of imagination + focus + meditation. Its about balance, its not a binary choice.</p><p>Every time I tried to help someone else unconditionally, I ended up being the main beneficiary. It does take years to materialize (or even decades, e.g your kids would benefit), but karma is a real thing.</p><p>Habit changes that improved my life. 1) movies -&amp;gt; books2) high-carb diet -&amp;gt; low-carb diet3) eating 3 times/day -&amp;gt; eating once/day4) constant music -&amp;gt; valuing silence5) light working out -&amp;gt; training hard6) reacting w/ anger -&amp;gt; staying mindful7) ego contests -&amp;gt; indifference</p><p>I have a bunch of essays that won?t be included in my incoming book, but I will probably publish them later in a blog and/or send them through the newsletter. ??</p><p>Reading is how you learn from others. Writing is how you learn from yourself. Doing is how you truly deeply learn.</p><p>Your life gets better once you stop paying attention to the lives of others getting better.</p><p>School conditioned us all to believe life was a race. Learning fast to compete in exams. Writing fast to publish prolifically. Talking fast to look smart. Life is not a race. Learn at your own pace. Publish when your work is ready. Talk slowly as long as its clear.</p><p>Thank you ! ???? Twitter is time-consuming enough already. I prefer to focus on one platform and do things well.?? I mostly write for my own pleasure and further constraints would be detrimental. (I have an inactive Instagram account for some people who wanted to tag me.)</p><p>Years of rejection seem to be a prerequisite to success. Years of efforts seem to be a prerequisite to self-confidence. Years of writing seem to be a prerequisite to clear thinking. Years of solitude seem to be a prerequisite to healthy relationships.</p><p>Many writers are stuck in self-censorship. Everything that needs to be written, has already been written, and by better writers than I. This is false. If your words can benefit even one soul out there, you should do it. Build a writing habit. It will change your life.</p><p>And it simultaneously creates businesses.</p><p>Its normal to cringe when you read what you wrote a few years ago. It?s normal to cringe when you remember what you did a few years ago. Its normal to cringe when you think about who you were a few years ago. Cringing is healthy. A sign of growth.</p><p>Its easier to love others than to love yourself.</p><p>Its easier to trust others than to trust yourself.</p><p>Its easier to motivate others than to motivate yourself.</p><p>Reminded me of those unpaid internships in non-profit organizations profiting off unskilled and broke naive students. ??</p><p>If you don?t know how to contribute, proceed in concentric circles: 1) help yourself2) help your family3) help friends4) help your community5) help the world Don?t feel guilty for taking the time to educate yourself. Many skip 1). They end up unable to help anyone at all.</p><p>You see many 25-year-old brilliant minds full of drive and intellectual curiosity. You are convinced they will achieve great things in the future. Fastforward 20 years. A bunch are divorced, broke, unhappy. Why? Because life happened. Write down your priorities and values.</p><p>Seventy years ago, in 1950, there were also many rich investors, many good-looking, famous entertainers, models, singers, comedians, athletes, envied by many for their glamorous lives. The common point? They are all dead. You are alive. Stop paying attention to the noise.</p><p>1) Ideas need time to mature.2) Companies need time to grow.3) Talent needs time to develop.4) Relationships need time to strengthen.5) Good habits need time to reward.6) Trust needs time to get built.7) Investment needs time to compound. Success. The art of being patient.</p><p>Fastest way to make a bigger impact on the world: be financially independent. Real freedom of speech only starts when you no longer need a monthly salary.</p><p>A sign of intelligence: less focus on being right, more focus on learning. The bigger the fool, the bigger the ego.</p><p>They dont respect you unless you respect yourself. Signs of self-respect: - always do what you said you would (self-esteem) - never stop halfway (keeping up efforts till full mastery) - value time alone (to think clearly  grow) - high standards (self-surrounded by the driven)</p><p>Great businessmen with a broken family. Attractive celebrities with no loving spouse. Gifted musicians caught in drugs. Insightful writers caught in depression. There is always a trade-off. You can?t shine without darkness. You want their talent, also take their impediment.</p><p>Smart and honest people have one problem. They project themselves. They think their common sense and principles are shared by all. They drop their guard, often thinking: ?No one would do something so stupid.? Well, people often disappoint you.</p><p>Thank you ! It does sound far less convoluted :-)</p><p>Be strong. A lot fewer people will bother you. Be smart. A lot fewer people will argue with you. Be rich. You can stay away from a lot of people. Be talented. A lot more people will respect you. You cant control people. But you can control who you are.</p><p>When everything goes downhill, no shelter, no money, no food, no health, guess who will offer unconditional help? Your family. Many treat poorly people closest to them. Smart people never take anyone for granted.</p><p>The greatest artists are weird. The greatest scientists are weird. The greatest entrepreneurs are weird. Being weird is a superpower. Have the courage to stand alone.</p><p>Age 18, I was mentorless and clueless. Advice I?d give myself: 1) Stick to the hard disciplines. Maths, physics, computer science.2) Study abroad. The more different the culture, the better.3) Allocate time everyday to read both fictions and non-fictions.4) Meet more people.</p><p>That?s what the Internet is for ????</p><p><span><a href="https://t.co/aFWw5DaMcP">https://t.co/aFWw5DaMcP</a></span></p><p>7 signs of unintelligence. 1) Always blame someone. 2) Quick to anger and cynicism. 3) Live through others. 4) Talk lengthily, provide little value. 5) Screw up all their relationships, don?t understand why. 6) Can?t think long-term. 7) Live mechanically, mindlessly.</p><p>Everyone is thinking a lot. You are not smarter because you think more. You are smarter because you figured out how to not think when you don?t need it.</p><p>10 things you probably dont want. 1) Sex without love2) Work without meaning3) Money without health4) Family without trust5) Status without self-esteem6) Looks without brains7) Theory without practice8) Time without peace9) Growth without joy10) Days without a smile</p><p>Self-doubt is fuel for growth. Its healthy and justified,  but its important to filter accurately. A rule that simplified my life: hang out with happy, successful people, with people who seek growth themselves, with people with higher ambitions. They dont stir up drama.</p><p>Its not scary to be disliked. Its not scary to be judged. Its not scary to be humiliated. Living a numb, scripted life. Disliking yourself. Waking up every morning depressed. Not standing up for your own principles. These are scary. Its your life. Think for yourself.</p><p>Jumping from one investment to another, and you never grasp real wealth. Jumping from one partner to another, and you never grasp real love. Jumping from one skill to another, and you never grasp real talent. Long-term thinking, real value.</p><p>A bunch of smart people are late bloomers, because they tend to live in their minds, and overthink the simplest decisions. Until they realize no one cares, and that they should try, and fail, and learn.</p><p>Underrated habits: - reading science-fiction (esp. old books) - walking unplugged (no music) - long conversations (2 hours+) - being mindful (reactions, judgments) - doing nothing (esp. in investing) - spending time alone (unstimulated) - writing without publishing expectations</p><p>A relaxed mind is a creative mind. It?s hard to relax when you are broke. To be creative,  take care of financial issues first.</p><p>You will be depressed without a creative hobby. You will be anxious without a physical activity. You will be angry without a loving family. You will be unconfident without personal achievements. You will be all of the above without a healthy gut microbiome.</p><p>If you neglect your physical appearance, and expect to shine through sheer intellect, you are not as smart as you think. Being attractive opens up a lot of opportunities. A big correlation between physical  mental health anyway. Dont apologize for taking care of yourself.</p><p>People love numbers. The bank account, a measure of success. The number of followers, a measure of credibility. Weight lifting contests. Countries traveled. Hours of practice. Grades. I.Q. Many end up overlooking what cant be quantified: love, health, peace, self-esteem.</p><p>We are all struggling to strike the right balance ??</p><p>Some signs of intelligence. 1) enjoy time spent alone (= value peace) 2) dislike small talks (= value time) 3) calm (= value clear mind) 4) avid reader (= value knowledge) 5) risk-taker (= value growth) 6) prolific writer (= value self-discovery) 7) listen (= value people)</p><p>Comfort kills growth. Comfort kills ambitions. Comfort kills big dreams. Kill comfort.</p><p>Crisis and opportunity are the same. Just a matter of preparation and perspective.</p><p>Anything worth doing requires years: - getting fit - writing a book - investing money - building a family - building a company - getting clear-minded - learning how to code - understanding yourself - learning a foreign language</p><p>No one is ignoring you. People are busy working hard. You are just unfocused.</p><p>Think of yourself as a movie director, and live a life worth watching for the audience. You want elements of surprise (= risk-taking) but also likely, a happy ending (= love, success.) Figure out the right balance.

Anyone can play any musical instrument. Anyone can have an athletic, attractive body. Anyone can become a good public speaker. At any age. But growth is painful. It requires self-doubt and efforts.

Don?t be slave to zero-sum games.</p><p>The worst thing you can do when tired: mindlessly scrolling, aimlessly reading, stupidly staring. Your smartphone exists to empower, not to enslave.</p><p>The richer you get,  the less you talk about money.</p><p>There is no secret to eloquence: daily reading and writing. Doesn?t matter if you are a cook, a software developer, a flight attendant, a gardener, an athlete, a farmer, a model, a monk, when your verbal skills are lacking, you miss plenty of ?easy? opportunities.</p><p>You dont need a reason to be happy. You just need healthier habits.</p><p>The dream life: rich, anonymous, loved, healthy.</p><p>You will never write a perfect book. You will never build a perfect product. You will never meet a perfect partner. You will never lead a perfect life. Throw away your ideals. Perfect only exists in your mind. Reality is imperfect. And its perfect as it is.</p><p>You never feel old if you never stop learning.</p><p>Yeah. Id add you cant think long-term (no savings whatsoever,) you cant think clearly (stress + cheap/unhealthy food,) you have no investment, no hope for a brighter future, you cant afford any social activity, let alone traveling, you focus on saving, not earning more, etc.</p><p>If you?ve never been poor, you probably underestimate the impact of financial anxiety on the intellect.</p><p>Yeah, everyone has different circumstances  their own battle. I used to consume a lot of books when I was very financially constrained, but nothing could have replaced the past four years Ive spent in Japan. There are things you can understand only through direct experience.</p><p>Constant scrolling is how you end up angry, cynical, lonely, misinformed, depressed. Tips: ? pick up a real book. few hours of peace. ? have meaningful conversations with people you love. ? travel. explore through your own eyes. ? spend your energy. be mindful. smile. live.</p><p>Successful relationships are about looking at yourself objectively. ?Would I trust someone like me?? ?Would I respect someone like me?? ?Would I love someone like me?? Then, you go make adjustments.</p><p>When you are studying, you have time and energy, but no money. When you are working, you have money and energy, but no time. When you are old and retired, you have money and time, but no energy.</p><p>Indeed. Hence the importance of experimenting with your own body with discipline over the course of several months, even years. Over the past five years, I personally switched from high carbs (~ cheap, processed food) to mostly meat/fish/vegetables. Do what works for you.</p><p>I make a mental distinction between traveling and tourism.</p><p>Books have never been cheaper. Traveling has never been cheaper. Healthy food has never been cheaper. And yet, people read little, seldom go abroad, have terrible diets. Distinguishing price from value has never been more important.</p><p>If all the books you read are boring, if all the people you meet are annoying, if all the songs you listen to are ugly, if all the cities you visit are unexciting, switch your mindset, from constantly judging to open-minded.</p><p>Ignoring distractions is a superpower.</p><p>Imagine the person you want around. And become that person. Imagine the product you want to use. And build that product. Imagine the book you want to read. And write that book. Imagine the story you want to watch. And live that story.</p><p>Imagine yourself 5 years from now. Focus on the right habits, become the right person. Imagine society 10 years from now. Build and invest in the right technologies. Imagine life with your partner 20 years from now. Marry the right person. Imagination is all you need.</p><p>You can truly wish for someone else?s happiness only when you?re happy yourself.</p><p>Stop worrying about ?being late.? You are not that important. You can start anything at 10, 30, 50, 70; a few generations will pass, everything will be forgotten. If you are smart, be foolish. Make your daily life an adventure. If you are smart, enjoy here and now.</p><p>Signs of intelligence. 1) You own your mistakes. 2) You aren?t scared of looking stupid. 3) You learn from practical experience, not just books. 4) You avoid others? mistakes. 5) You leverage imagination for long-term thinking. 6) You have your own way of doing things.</p><p>Success all comes down to one habit: Doing things even when you don?t feel like it.

Good-looking people attract good-looking people. Driven people attract driven people. Kind people attract kind people. Interesting people attract interesting people. You want change, start changing.

Growing up poor is uncomfortable. Being ignored is uncomfortable. Building a company is uncomfortable. Failing over and over is uncomfortable. The secret of growth: Be comfortable with the uncomfortable.</p><p>The less money you need, the more money you make, because you can afford to be patient, and focus on long-term value creation.</p><p>Five key lessons from the past five years. 1) You can learn a whole lot more than you think. 2) There are a lot more opportunities than you think. 3) Your nutrition has a huge impact on your mental health. 4) Mindfulness is the most important habit. 5) Life is about people.</p><p>Observations. 1) In many poor families, money is taboo. 2) In many dysfunctional families, love is taboo. 3) In many struggling families, regret is taboo. 4) In many ignorant families, death is taboo. People are scared of discussing precisely what they should talk about.</p><p>It doesnt matter how smart someone is, never blindly trust the judgment of another. Everyone is full of blind spots. Everyone makes mistakes. I could calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies,  but not the madness of the people. ? Isaac Newton, after losing $3 million.</p><p>Try to work out two hours everyday. You are fit after a few years. Try to read two hours everyday. You are knowledgeable after a few years. Try to sit down, and think, and write, two hours everyday. You are smart after a few years. Most fail to put in enough time  efforts.</p><p>At any time of your life, you should be learning something new. Sports you were curious to try. Books from unrelated fields. Musical instruments you used to play. Foreign languages you deemed useless. Conversations with unique minds. Never lose learning momentum.</p><p>The less politics in your life, the better your mental health.</p><p>What mistakes do you think your parents did, that you will avoid?

Old people want their youth back. Sick people want their health back. Lonely people want their family back. But also, many easily ditch their privacy, and they waste their youth,  and neglect their health, and overlook their family.</p><p>If you have no idea what you are doing with your life, don?t worry. Everyone is exactly in the same boat.</p><p>Precursors of success. 1) Calmness (= good judgment)2) Initiative (= constant growth)3) Kindness (= likable )4) Honesty (= no self-deception)5) Optimism (= try and fail, often)6) Clarity (= see the big picture)7) Patience (= understand power law)8) Focus (= do things)</p><p>You have millions of ancestors, who suffered from hunger, war, disease, ignorance, and yet, managed to survive sufficiently long enough, to mate, and have kids, who had kids, who had kids... all the way down to you. You got this one life.  You choose what to do with it.</p><p>Once you bought the right investment, just hold for ten years. Once you understood how to learn best, just maintain momentum for ten years. Once you figured out the right habits, just diligently apply for ten years. Value, just a decade of discipline.</p><p>Life is full of ups and downs. The healthiest person today can be sick next year. The happiest person today can be depressed next year. The loveliest family today can be broken next year. Be kind when you are on your ups. We all appreciate kindness on our downs.</p><p>Read old books no one talks about. They are your competitive advantage.</p><p>Common causes of unhappiness: 1) Little time for your beloved ?? 2) Little time for outdoor activities ?? 3) Little time for learning slowly ?? 4) Little time for eating healthy ?? 5) Little time for sleeping  ?? 6) Little time for doing nothing ??????? Money solves it all.</p><p>One word at a time. Ten chapters later, you have a great book. One small problem at a time. Ten solutions later, you solved a big problem. One idea at a time. Ten iterations later, you have a great mind. One customer at a time. Ten years later,  you have a great business.</p><p>Everyone has a lot more to learn from their parents than they think.</p><p>Writing principles: ? If it requires a lot of research, it?s not ?the book only you can write.? ? Simplify as much as you can, but avoid excessive concision. It feels soulless. ? Seek to be clear, not to impress. ? Read the brightest. ? Write everyday. Even when uninspired.</p><p>Last words: ? The education system is not perfect but gives chances to people who had none. ? Many dream of the opportunities you take for granted. ? The world is globalized.  Your responsibility to figure out the best value for money. Don?t blame the system for your mistakes.</p><p>7) I wouldn?t have had the chance to unlearn bad habits. With perfect guidance from the start, I wouldn?t understand ?most people.? I would be a well-read intellectual at most, all about theoretical knowledge, clueless about the difficulty to escape the traps set by society.</p><p>6) I?d have skipped the hard things. Unless you are educated otherwise, you take the path of least resistance. Mathematics. Physics. Computer science. The foundations of my thinking. Competitive exams did provide an environment to learn deeper. They raised my standards.</p><p>5) I wouldn?t understand poverty. You can?t buy books. Any club activity is too expensive. Parents struggling for rent and food: you won?t ask more from them. Many classmates were in the same boat. Poverty is very hard to escape. It?s always easy to judge ?from above.?</p><p>4) I would not speak English. Curiosity requires fuel: if you never meet foreigners, if you cannot travel due to tight finances, you don?t see the value of broadening your worldview. Even casual social events cost money. You become a cheapskate.</p><p>3) I?d have a narrower perspective. My parents knew little about society. Barely speaking the local language. Affluent in poor neighborhoods: racism. bullying. thieves. homelessness. threatening stray dogs. mentally unstable people. Practical experience was my teacher.</p><p>(THREAD)  A contrarian take on education. I?m mostly self-educated. But without school: 1) I?d be stuck in my hometown. The escape: good university. scholarship. life abroad. 2) I?d have missed opportunities. many great minds in academia. investments. meaningful friends.</p><p>You don?t want money. You want the freedom to quit jobs you dislike. You don?t want to be left alone. You want people who understand you. You don?t want entertainment. You want freedom from your mind. You don?t want retirement. You want the freedom to pursue what you love.</p><p>How to instantly improve your life. 1) Dont be afraid of being judged. 2) Dont seek validation. 3) Dont take everything too seriously. 4) Stop clinging to the past.  5) Stop thinking of people you dislike. 6) Stop living in your mind.</p><p>There will always be, another book to read, another skill to acquire, another year to save money. Meanwhile, opportunities come and go. You will never be ready. Just do it.</p><p>The best friendships are built with successful people. They wont project any limitation on you. They are focused on nobler causes. They dont parrot mainstream views. They are neither insecure nor time-wasting. They are genuinely happy when you succeed.</p><p>Lack of talent is lack of focus. Lack of focus is just another bad habit.</p><p>The flashier your online coverage, the unhappier your offline personal life. The happiest people are smart enough to be invisible.</p><p>You attract who you subconsciously think you deserve.</p><p>To get a better life,  get better friends. To get better friends, become a better person. To become a better person, question your beliefs everyday.</p><p>No one cares about what you think today unless you executed on what you thought yesterday.</p><p>Life is unfair. Which is great. You might get gifts you don?t deserve. Life is unpredictable. Which is also great. You might get chances you don?t expect.</p><p>Life is always hard. Your body will get sick. Your mind will get crazy. Your beloved will get taken away. But also. The thrill of your efforts paying off. Your dots of knowledge connecting. Loving someone more than yourself. Life is worth living because it is hard.</p><p>People suddenly like you when you are rich. People suddenly like you when you are attractive. People suddenly like you when you are smart. The people you want in your life? Those who treat everyone the same. They won?t ignore you when you actually need them.</p><p>If you are in your twenties and scared of failing, you are failing. No one expects anything from you. Go out there. Explore. Try. Fail. You will be grateful in your thirties.</p><p>Responding to stupidity with anger is a sign of stupidity.</p><p>You can watch any movie. You can listen to any song. You can learn about anything. For nearly free. The new currency is your attention. We became time investors. Failed investments = depression. Successful investments = growth + happiness. Be mindful. Think long-term.</p><p>Once you are on a truly unique path, you can avoid competition, but until then, find worthy rivals. They will accelerate your growth.</p><p>Don?t fall in love with an image. Don?t get lost in a label. Don?t get attached to an idea. Don?t forget it?s all approximations. Don?t mistake model and reality.</p><p>No one succeeds alone. You will need: ? inspiring mentors ? supportive family ? growing, loyal friends ? public order, good regulations ? an optimistic inner voice ? some stroke of luck</p><p>Don?t focus on being rich. Focus on learning valuable skills. Don?t focus on finding love. Focus on becoming a better person. Don?t focus on being fit. Maintain a healthier lifestyle. Don?t focus on being smart. Maintain a writing habit. Don?t focus on being happy. Be happy.</p><p>To draw more value from books, pause and think more often.</p><p>Throw away what you dont need. Relationships going nowhere. Hobbies you barely enjoy. Food that makes you sick. Pessimistic thoughts. You will make space for what you need. Meaningful relationships. Passion, talent, self-confidence. Athleticism and energy. Effortless joy.</p><p>Business tips. People help you when they like you. People pay when they like your product. People trust you when they have known you for years. People invest in you when you show growth.</p><p>Treasure people you love. They will be gone one day. You will feel like an idiot for not noticing the obvious, just because you were busy running a winnerless race. Life is about the people right next to you.</p><p>No one is ever as happy as you think. No matter their wealth, health, family. Everyone has their own struggles.</p><p>If you dislike your current self, change. If you dislike your current city, move. If you dislike your current mood, walk. If you dislike your current coworkers, quit. If you dislike your current job, start up. If you dislike your current growth, try harder.</p><p>Success requires paranoia and trust. Talent requires pride and humility. Happiness requires efforts and relaxation. We are walking contradictions.</p><p>Entrepreneurship should be part of your curriculum. You try to build a business,  you probably fail, and then: (1) you settle in a company with no regret, knowing how hard it is to build one or (2) you feel like you grew, with better ideas. ?I can do more.? And you try again.</p><p>Financial markets teach you about your greed. Unintelligent people teach you about your anger. Life abroad teaches you about your ignorance. But also... Wise people teach you calmness. Educated people teach you respect. Happy people teach you kindness.</p><p>Ending thoughts: Don?t try to become the next anyone. Opportunities are never obvious. Hard work may not guarantee success but no work guarantees failure. Focus on great customer experience, not money. It takes time to create something valuable. Enjoy the process.</p><p>10) Reid Hoffman. ???? Linkedin.

But in the end, you want a native level, you need to read tons of books, and write tons of drafts.</p><p>Smart people raise issues. Smarter people solve them.</p><p>It?s a compulsory step. But many seem to think, ?I did a great job. I ?finished? one book,? like they would after one session of workout. That?s not enough to get fit, physically or intellectually. Real efforts last years. And they require more than one type of exercise.</p><p>Reading is not thinking. It does help, to expand your views, clarify important concepts, understand how the smart think. But it is merely the first step. Words only capture a portion of reality. Don?t become a soulless parrot. Especially when thinking is the fun part.</p><p>When you do what you love, envy mostly goes away. When you trust, and are trusted, anxiety mostly goes away. When you love, and are loved, anger mostly goes away. Add some mindfulness, and you are mostly happy.</p><p>Success is the art of fasting. Food fasting. Information fasting. Entertainment fasting. Social fasting. Only consume what you need.</p><p>Your best decisions will never feel like the best decisions at the time.</p><p>You can?t be kind without courage. You can?t be talented without focus. You can?t be happy without detachment.</p><p>School reunions are a waste of time.</p><p>If you truly respect yourself, sooner or later, people will do the same. Not taking care of your body, not feeding your mind with new ideas, are both signs of self-disrespect.</p><p>The more memorization you need to get a job, the more likely it?s the wrong job.</p><p>Forget about your hard earned money. Forget about a second home in heaven. Forget about the next Bitcoin halvening. At the end of your life, all you will care about, is the meaningful time, spent with meaningful people.</p><p>Losers want validation, winners want results.</p><p>There are plenty of millionaires out there, who started, no smarter than you, no more charismatic, with no better connections. The reasons they made it: constant initiative, humble yet ambitious, a long-term vision, and most importantly: bravery.</p><p>????</p><p>I surround myself with happy and self-confident people of all ages. Will have to wait and see for the younger folks, but my friends in their 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, all had very unique experiences in their 20s. Will include anecdotes in my book. Wishing you all the best ????</p><p>Most successful people simply had the courage to be different in their twenties.</p><p>??????</p><p>Thank you ????</p><p>We all learn stupidity at some point. Don?t forget to unlearn it.</p><p>They call the confident ?arrogant.? They call the kind ?naive.? They call the honest ?mean.? They call the successful ?lucky.? They call the happy ?stupid.? People dislike what remind them of their flaws.</p><p>Anger, a bad habit. Unneeded judging, a bad habit. Self-victimizing, a bad habit. Lack of smile, a bad habit. Expecting from others, a bad habit. Living in your mind, a bad habit.</p><p>Every time you think you will remember an idea: you won?t. Unless you write it down. Immediately.</p><p>It?s unfortunate, that some people closest to you, will never be able to see your true worth, will never be able notice your growth, because they can?t update their old image of you.</p><p>They say they lack talent. They only lack focus. They say they lack self-confidence. They only lack initiative. They say they lack eloquence. They only lack practice. They say they lack smartness. They only lack hard work.</p><p>I see no disagreement. Never implied they succeeded because they were just early. Of course it takes a decade of disciplined hard work and constant learning.</p><p>In 2010, YouTube wasn?t that big. Podcasting wasn?t that big. Bitcoin neither. Here we are. 
Those who built an audience, or invested long-term, all made millions. Now. Think 
Look around you. Travel. Understand trends. Where are we heading? Get there first.</p><p>Success is when you no longer feel envy.</p><p>If you are angry,  learn from the calm. If you are insecure,  learn from the confident. If you are anxious, learn from the wise. If you are unhappy,  learn from the happy. The worst course of action: staying away from them, because they make you feel uncomfortable.</p><p>You won?t become a great conversationalist by just listening to podcasts. Engage conversations. You won?t become a clear thinker by just reading. Write. You won?t become happy by just passively consuming. Actively create.</p><p>You are rich if you can take your time.</p><p>If you?re not tired at the end of the day, work harder. If you?re too tired at the end of the day, work smarter.</p><p>I think they mean ?making more efforts, striving for more growth.?</p><p>Things old people never say: ?I wish I had drunk more.? ?I wish I had argued more.? ?I wish I didn?t have a family.? ?I wish I had worked more.? ?I wish I had stayed in my comfort zone.?</p><p>Forget about winning: figure out instead which games are worth playing.</p><p>Write what you want to read. Build what you want to have. Be the person you would love.</p><p><span>Some probably apply: <a href="https://t.co/kKMIy8uQJz">https://t.co/kKMIy8uQJz</a></span></p><p>You learn best when it?s fun. Follow your interests. You think clearly when you?re calm. Practice mindfulness. You are creative when free. Routine, not constraints.</p><p>If you never spend time alone, you are likely to end up alone: when you lack self-understanding, all your relationships are a mess.</p><p>No one is ignoring you. Everybody moves on. You should too.</p><p>If you are never wrong, you are doing something wrong. Even the smartest constantly ?fail.? No mistake, no growth.</p><p>You are smart if you figured out how to wake up every morning with a smile.</p><p>If your mind isn?t your most valuable asset, you will have to sell your time.</p><p>You are not anxious,  you are unfocused. You are not unloved, you are not loving. You don?t lack self-confidence, you lack doing. You are not depressed, you are living in your mind.</p><p>Hints towards ?this person will succeed in life.? ? they act quickly. ex: book recommendation? they already read it the following week. ? they maintain long-term relationships. ? they grow every year. ? they are optimistic. ? they never blame. ? they help around. ? they smile.</p><p>I agree. The energy spent could be redirected towards value creation. It?s about when, mostly for financial reasons, you currently don?t have room to breathe, yet, wish to retain your integrity.</p><p>Every time your mind tells you ?I feel lazy,? ignore it, and act. Every time your mind tells you ?I feel angry,? don?t react. Every time your mind tells you ?I am depressed,? go for a walk, get some sun, lift. Every time your mind tells you ?I can?t learn it,? prove it wrong.</p><p>The insecure will never trust you: they don?t even trust themselves. The best relationships are built between self-confident, happy people.</p><p>If they haven?t changed in the past two years, they will never change. Invest in people who grow instead.</p><p>Give a smart entrepreneur $1 million. Give a government $1 million. Give them five years to create value. The difference is called skin in the game.</p><p>Success is a lonely path. Growth is a lonely path. Talent is a lonely path. Don?t be scared of loneliness.</p><p>It?s also difficult, to not live in your mind, to not react when unneeded, to not grow cynical, to not expect, but give, to throw away old beliefs, to do something no one has done, to avoid self-deception, to love, and not just an idea, to keep your integrity, to be authentic.</p><p>If you don?t have any long-term meaningful relationship today, the problem is you. To fix it, stop deceiving yourself into thinking you are a good person. Good people always end up surrounded with good people. Your inner narrative doesn?t matter.</p><p>To improve the quality of your life, improve the quality of your conversations.</p><p>Being contrarian doesn?t mean: ? hating the popular ? trying to be unique ? constantly disagreeing Being contrarian means: ? thinking independently ? being unique ? lifelong education ? taking responsibility</p><p>Silence forces you to listen to your mind. As your mind talks less nonsense, and more ideas, insights, wisdom, silence also becomes more enjoyable.</p><p>To be a great innovator, imagine the future. To be a great teacher, imagine the struggle of beginners. To be a great artist, imagine what moves people. To be a great scientist, imagine what predecessors missed. To be great, imagine, and apply.</p><p>Yeah, it has to be effortless, not forced.</p><p>Ideal partner: Someone you love unconditionally, who loves you unconditionally, growing at the same speed, in the same direction.</p><p>Suppose you could suddenly, get as attractive, athletic, smart, knowledgeable, rich, and talented, as you wanted. You may go around, have fun with life, never ?settle,? till age catches up to you, and wisdom finally appears: life was about meaningful relationships.</p><p>Even smart people occasionally forget it?s all games, meant to entertain us, a bunch of self-conscious atoms, insignificant on the scale of the universe, insignificant in the chronological river of time, and yet, so self-important, so caught up in futile worries, so lost.</p><p>For every winner,  you have one or many losers. Trading stocks for example.</p><p>You are average when you lack the courage to get rid of old, comfortable habits.</p><p>Interesting. I don?t know. Unless you can unfold both scenarios, and see the whole movie of both lives, I?ve learnt from experience, that both the best and worst decisions stem from seemingly inconsequential actions.</p><p>For 2014-2019, if I?m not mistaken, amongst opportunities open to most: ?Buy the Ethereum ICO. Sell in January 2018 at $1400.? Similarly, in 2024, we may look back on 2019, regret some missed opportunities, and tell ourselves: ?it was obvious.? The human mind ???????</p><p>If I had a call with 5-year-ago me, only ten seconds, and no possibility of financial advice, I?d say: ?you can learn more than you think. spend less time in your mind. spend more time doing.?</p><p>School taught people to do what they didn?t want to do, conditioning them to live the life they didn?t want to live.</p><p>If you want to be successful, surround yourself with the successful, but dont wait till they are successful. Once successful, they no longer seek new relationships, they only maintain the previous ones, with people who believed in them, when no one else did.</p><p>Different minds learn best differently, but sitting down every day, contemplating your thoughts, writing them down, reading them the following day, improving them, over and over again, throughout the months and years, will definitely make you smarter.</p><p>You want a better life, make better decisions. To make better decisions, be a clearer thinker. To be a clearer thinker, befriend selectively, read selectively, eat selectively, and write.</p><p>Ignore distractions, imagine tomorrow, seek driven people, focus on what you love. Do all four every day, success will find you.</p><p>To grow, read more. To grow faster, think more. To grow fastest, write more.</p><p>Couldn?t agree more ??</p><p>You can use Twitter to... ? teach and help ? build connections ? improve your writing ? broadcast your ideas ? market your products ? waste your time arguing ? study a foreign language ? learn from brighter minds ? broaden your perspectives ? improve your sense of humor ??</p><p>People change. They move on. You change. You move on. Don?t keep alive what?s doomed. Make space for valuable relationships.</p><p>Hating the successful only makes you more unsuccessful. The smart learn from them.</p><p>You are rich if you are calm.</p><p>Only the stupid respond to anger with anger. The smart respond with indifference.</p><p>Find a mentor. Someone ?your kind,? who understands you, who has succeeded, who has what you want, who will gladly help. The right mentor will change your life.</p><p>You will be valued more if you talk less to say more.</p><p>You make wrong decisions when you get emotional, and unfortunately, everybody gets emotional when it comes to their family.</p><p>If you never ask for help, you will never get any. You won?t build your success alone. Counterintuitively: many successful people out there, ready to help, are just waiting for you to ask.</p><p>I can?t understand how most people, eat three times a day, spend money on what yields nothing, willingly eat what makes them sick, mindlessly watch empty videos, travel just to take pictures, talk regardless of value providing. All of it whilst thinking they are smart. ???????</p><p>I hope you?re doing okay ?? Stay strong. Stay kind.  Support people you love, and people you need will find you in return.</p><p>Wishing you a great life too ! ???? May you have a life full of love, success, and smiles ??</p><p>Everyone wants to be a clear, well-articulated speaker; but few even read, and even fewer write. You may as well say: ?I want to grow without efforts.?</p><p>To be a good investor, buy what they want before they do. To be a good businessman, build what they want before anyone know. To be a good mind, learn when you can before you need. To be a good friend, teach each other before no one can.</p><p>Everyone should own a business, to understand how marketing works. Everyone should be creative, to appreciate the work of others. Everyone should be strong, to understand how the confident think. Everyone should be growing, to appreciate a lifetime of happiness.</p><p>Thank you ??????</p><p>Most impactful event of 2019: my near-death experience (sepsis in March.) It clarified all my priorities. It made me a calmer and kinder person. It taught me to take life less seriously. Any interesting anecdote for 2019?</p><p>Your best thoughts. Your best decisions. Your best relationships. Your best opportunities. Stop seeking them. Seek to create long-term value. Everything else will follow.</p><p>Fastest way to be smart: stop looking for shortcuts, be curious about everything, and never skip a day of learning. Coincidentally, also the most fun way to live life.</p><p>The more money you have, the less you care about making money, the more you care about creating value, the more money you make.</p><p>Success only requires the courage to spend effortful time alone.</p><p>As you get smarter, fewer and fewer people attempt to bullshit you. The weak only prey on the weak.</p><p>If you boast about your money, you are not as rich as you think. If you boast about your skills, you are not as good as you think. If you boast about your life, you are not as happy as you think.</p><p>Write daily. You will notice, year after year, how much you repeat yourself. The goal: writing a life that never feels repetitive.</p><p>Good students get good grades. Great students learn.</p><p>Money doesn?t buy happiness, but it?s better to be rich and unhappy than poor and unhappy.</p><p>Terminology of the successful: When they say ?patient,? they mean, a decade. When they say ?discipline,? they mean, every day a few hours. When they say ?courage,? they mean, going against the consensus. When they say ?happy,? they mean, creating what they love.</p><p>Too many parents teach their kids anxiety by arguing daily in front of them.</p><p>If you have time to argue online, you are already amongst the luckiest human beings that ever lived.</p><p>Many conversations take wrong turns, because people are scared of silence. They?d rather say something valueless, than leaving a blank. If you run out of interesting ideas, you need to learn more, and start living a life worth telling, not compensate with empty words.</p><p>You can?t be bored, only ignorant of the possibilities this world offers.</p><p>The key to success: surrounding yourself with extremely driven people.</p><p>Don?t be scared of spending time alone. Don?t be scared of looking ridiculous. Don?t be scared of feeling worthless. Be scared of not growing. Be scared of wasting your potential. Be scared of missing out on life.</p><p>If you never walk, you never think. If you never write, you never understand. If you never teach, you never learn.</p><p>Thank you ????</p><p>Some students spend ten hours a day educating themselves on everything. Some students spend ten hours a day entertaining themselves with nothing. The Internet is creating simultaneously, both the biggest generation of geniuses, and the biggest generation of idiots.</p><p>If you have never been poor, you understand neither yourself, nor society. It?s easy to intellectualize everything from the comfort and safety of wealth.</p><p>Your best investment is in yourself, and your second best, in people who invest in themselves.</p><p>If you ?meditate every day,? but when the unexpected happens, you get all flustered and irritated, you completely miss the point. Meditation isn?t to be scheduled. It?s constant awareness. It?s mindful living.</p><p>You want to think differently, you need to live differently.</p><p>Fastest way to reshape your mind: write every day. About what? Start with the Big Bang, and link it to your current existence, in some sort of autobiography. It forces you to learn. It forces you to think. It forces you to grow.</p><p>I agree. Blaming the victim is never the right move. Too late to edit, but I won?t make the mistake in my book ??</p><p><span><a href="https://t.co/1dZJssl88F">https://t.co/1dZJssl88F</a></span></p><p>I tend to assume to best from anyone until proven wrong. Which happened repeatedly in various areas, unfortunately. But no one is to be blamed. It?s hard to untangle the truths from the lies. If I had never unlearnt, I would probably never have understood ?true learning.?</p><p>Depends on your stage of life, but look into philosophy and science. The difficult books from people who enormously contributed to mankind. Look around, follow your curiosity, ask yourself how it all started, and how some minds built the frameworks unlocking modern society.</p><p>The healthiest food, rarely advertised. The greatest books, rarely best-sellers. The best locations, hidden from tourism. The happiest people, never famous.</p><p>The happiest people tend to be: ? loved ? healthy ? mindful ? optimistic ? rich in time ? creating everyday</p><p>They won?t tell you to fix bad habits. They will give you a pill. They won?t teach you about money. They will give you a loan. They won?t encourage creation. They will give you entertainment. If you still trust ?higher authorities,? you deserve to be sick, poor, depressed.</p><p>Changing your environment works pretty well.</p><p>Most people are addicts. They are always high. The drug is sugar. If you never fasted, you have yet to experience a clear mind.</p><p>Things you will never regret: ? spending time with people you love ? reading books from the brightest ? cultivating long-term friendships ? taking time off a job you dislike ? learning a foreign language ? building a stronger body ? being mindful ? taking a walk ? living abroad</p><p>When you try to impress others, you fail to respect yourself.</p><p>Intelligence is about not judging when you don?t need to, and not wasting time with inner monologues that lead nowhere.</p><p>Life gets easier once you get harder on yourself.</p><p>Everybody should say ?I don?t know,? and ?I don?t understand,? a lot more often. And they should say ?I don?t remember,? a lot less often. Memorization is a cancer for the truth.</p><p>The value of a book depends on the mind that reads the sequence of characters.</p><p>Arguing with the unintelligent is a sign of unintelligence. Wiser: smile, ignore, breathe, forget.</p><p>Helping others is the most enjoyable way to help yourself. Encourage others,  you end up motivated. Love others, you end up loving yourself. Teach others, you end up learning.</p><p>You are rich if you can quit anytime. Not because you are financially free, but because you value freedom, or time with people you love, more than zero-sum games of signaling. There?s always another job out there. Wealth is a mindset, not a number.</p><p>The Internet, either your greatest teacher, or your worst distraction. Food, either supporting your growth, or destroying your health. Imagination, either improving your life decisions, or making you overly anxious. Any tool, either your greatest ally, or your worst enemy.</p><p>In bad terms with your parents? Ask yourself: if they were gone tomorrow, would you have any regret? Forget about their ?flaws,? or what they didn?t do for you. Expectations are your mistake. Your life is their gift.</p><p>Mental peace, the art of surrounding yourself with people you fully trust.</p><p>You don?t lack eloquence: you just don?t teach enough. You don?t lack talent: you don?t spend enough time alone. You don?t lack intelligence: you mistake memorizing for learning.</p><p>Don?t focus on making money. Focus on providing something people want, because that?s something you want too.</p><p>You can?t be an independent thinker unless you are financially independent.</p><p>You are poor if you don?t understand,  why you like what you like, why you want what you want, why you react the way you do. Notice your societal conditioning, become instantly rich.</p><p>When you never make mistakes,  you make the mistake of not learning.</p><p>Insecure people always seek someone else to blame. Family, friends, coworkers: you want to grow into a beautiful mind, stay away from the mindlessly judging, stay close to the mindfully kind.</p><p>Let?s say you are

Some things make sense. Some don?t. Truths and lies are intermingled. You struggle to connect the dots. You can get instant clarity. Now. With only one assumption. ?Most people are wrong.?</p><p>Overcoming anxiety is easy. Realize no one cares about you. You live, you die, that?s it. The rest is noise. Make it fun.</p><p>If you spend your time attacking others, you are unhappy.</p><p>Healthy people want healthy food. Smart people want difficult books. Everyone wants freedom.</p><p>When everyone is distracted, success is about focus. When everyone is outraged, success is about indifference. When everyone is scared, success is about initiative.</p><p>The comfort zone gives the illusion of talent. The growth zone gives the illusion of worthlessness. The reality is the other way around.</p><p>Things started to become more ?fun? after the 2nd year. Japanese is my 4th language. It just takes a while for your mind to figure out how to learn best.</p><p>To have money,  save money. To save money, consume less. To consume less, understand your desires. To understand your desires, be mindful. To be mindful, keep noticing your 20.000 breaths/day, reactions, thoughts, and feelings. Yes. Getting rich comes down to mindfulness.</p><p>The less you need money, the more patient you can be, the better your final product, and the more you will make money. To make money, have money.</p><p>Don?t fear smart people. Those who change year after year. They all end up understanding the value of integrity and honesty. Fear dumb people. Those who don?t grow. They live in a distorted reality. Their behavior doesn?t make sense. Their ignorance will cause you trouble.</p><p>People are scared of being mocked. For their income, status, appearance. They are scared of ?failing? and being shunned. They are not scared of, dying without doing what they love, overlooking their beloved, being sick, or not living on their own terms. People are irrational.</p><p>Thank you ! ????</p><p>Imagine. A world where people, spend more time indoors than outdoors, eat what makes them sick, consume and get depressed, trust entities profiting from them, fight those trying to improve things, trade their best years against money, to buy what they don?t need.

Learn fitness from world-class athletes. Money from world-class investors. Thinking from world-class scientists. Learn from the best. Only the best. Success is about ignoring noise.</p><p>The common point between great teachers, great doctors, great mentors? You no longer need them. They teach you, how to learn, how to take care of yourself, how to grow. They want you to be independent. You are not their cash cow.</p><p>If you think anyone ignores you on purpose, you have too much free time.</p><p>Creating makes you smarter. Consuming doesn?t. Traveling makes you smarter. Tourism doesn?t. Learning makes you smarter. Memorization doesn?t. Focusing makes you smarter. Mindlessness doesn?t. Humility makes you smarter.

Happy thanksgiving ! ????</p><p>Forget about looking smart, focus on being smarter. It makes you look stupid though. Forget about being loved, focus on loving yourself more. It takes courage though. Forget about being happy, focus on making others happy. It takes patience to get why though.</p><p>Being around insecure  ignorant people,  who tend to blame you for everything, and make you feel guilty for all your tentatives that end up being failures. Hence you stop trying. Hence you stop growing.</p><p>The smarter you are, the more you value freedom.</p><p>Many good people, thinking they are bad. Many smart people, thinking they are stupid.

Step 2: Spend less time in your mind. Step 3: Focus on a creative skill. Step 4: Keep it up for years. Step 5: Notice your mind is happy.</p><p>Observe how the non-rich spend, what the non-healthy eat, how the non-fit work out, how the unhappy treat people, and avoid their behaviors. Think about chess or tennis. Before you focus on winning, focus on not making too many mistakes.</p><p>The ?happiest people?? You don?t hear about them. They live a quiet and private life, far away from any competition, or the madness of overstimulation. They wake up with a smile, with a loving family, doing what they love, slowly.</p><p>Read a lot, cultivate a clear mind, and soon enough, you find podcasts  videos too slow, and not nearly as enjoyable anymore.</p><p>Read too much of what you don?t need, you get anxiety. Read too little of what you need, you get ignorance. Write just what you need to express, you get peace.</p><p>Lots of celebrities end up depressed, not because of fame, not because of expectations, but because of the path they took to reach success.

Don?t try to teach them. Just make them fall in love with learning.</p><p>Hard to blame people if you understand where they come from. Empathy solves anger.</p><p>In their 20s, most don?t define their principles. The reason why most relationships fail. There will always be someone, more attractive, more interesting, ?different.?

You will enjoy more. You will understand more. You will learn more.</p><p>Interesting question, thank you for asking. :)</p><p>For relationships, the ability to feel peoples minds, because you understand how you would react at their current stage of life, given their personality. For navigating society, connecting the historical dots from different cultural perspectives and predicting future trends.</p><p>Don?t expect anything for free, but be ready to give for free.</p><p>If you want to be rich, you learn about money. If you want to be attractive, you learn about nutrition and fitness. If you want to be happy, you learn about mindfulness. Many claim they want something, but they actually don?t.</p><p>The less you exercise, the less you can exercise. The less you imagine, the less you can imagine. The less you love, the less you can love. The more you focus, the more you can focus. The more you notice, the more you can notice. The more you learn, the more you can learn.</p><p>Most people don?t ?wake up,? not because they can?t, but because they don?t want to. Educating yourself is scary. It shatters wrong beliefs. It forces you to take responsibility. But overcome the fear of unlearning, and educating yourself is only fun.</p><p>Looking at society through the lenses of money does provide a sense of enlightenment.</p><p>Dear Twitter, Money is an open topic in my family.

Relationships that lead to no growth? Drop it. Habits that lead to low self-esteem? Unlearn. Environment that makes you depressed? Move out.</p><p>It?s easy to wake up, if you do what you love. It?s easy to get rich, if creating value is what you love. It?s easy to work hard, if it?s for people you love.</p><p>A real conversation requires two educated, clear, and curious minds. Most conversations are just two insecure minds talking in succession. Real conversations are so scarce, that there?s a business of podcasts.</p><p>If you understand everything you read, increase the difficulty. The smart surround themselves with the smarter. Because they want to feel stupid. Because they want to learn.</p><p>Poor mindset: build relationships because you need them. Rich mindset: build relationships because you want to exchange value. Poor mindset: learn because someone told you to. Rich mindset: learn because your curious mind wants to explore and grow.</p><p>Artists, intellectuals, writers: if you want their success, you may also want their distress. Detached from pecuniary interest, creating, for them, is not a job: it?s a matter of life and death. The most interesting people are also the most tortured souls.</p><p>The ideal life, something like: 1) enough money, no need to work2) healthy body, confident mind3) impact positively the lives of others4) do what you love, every day5) learn, grow, smile, every day6) see people you love, often You want (1)?

Later.</p><p>An interesting thought? Write it down. Immediately. Think you will remember later? You won?t. Many great ideas, every day, buried before inception.</p><p>Many people still think that success = ? prestigious credentials ? famous company ? high salary ? big house ? fancy car Only caring about external validation, they spend little time with people they love, little time doing what they love, little time being free and happy.</p><p>You are not poor when you lack money. You are poor when you worry about things that don?t matter, you are poor when your days are spent in irritation, you are poor when none of your smiles are authentic. Doing what you love.

Slow traveling, enjoyable traveling. Slow reading, enjoyable reading. You want more fun, just take it slow.</p><p>Mindfulness is how you understand, that your inner voice, your sluggishness, your boiling anger, your sense of purposelessness, none of them matters. You are not your thoughts. You are not your feelings. You are a result seeker. You wake up in the morning. And you do.</p><p>Most people will never tap into their true potential: scared of getting off the beaten track, scared of disappointing, scared of taking a year off to pursue their interests. Money. Status. They?re just stories. No one will care in a few generations. Go do what you love.</p><p>You want successful relationships, just be honest. You want talent, just be disciplined. You want money, just provide people what they want. You want health, just skip sugar and stress, and get sun and sleep. You want happiness, just be mindful.</p><p>Plenty of attractive people out there. A lot scarcer and valuable? People with integrity and the courage to stand up for their principles, who remain honest in a world of lies, who remain kind in a world of outrage.</p><p>The wise need no fame. The smart need no credential. The happy need no validation.</p><p>Dear outliers. As you try to make a positive impact, you will be met with resistance. People waiting for you to fail. ?Told you.? People staring at you with disdain. ?You shouldn?t do this.? You are the minority. The path will feel lonely. But keep going. It?s worth it.</p><p>The more you educate yourself, the less you value school.</p><p>Creatives who don?t create get anxious.</p><p>No disrespect intended ??</p><p>Most have no freedom from 3 to

Love your beloved before they?re gone. Invest in your mind before you need it. Intelligence is imagination + initiative.</p><p>Keep writing, and after a while, words flow out effortlessly, in the right grammatical form. And even if its not right, as long as you convey the intended meaning, thats fine imo. Words are just words. Language evolves either way.</p><p>Realize most of your fears arent worth it. Spend less time in your mind. Go out, meet people, hone your good judgment.</p><p>I completely agree. Reading is primordial. Its like weight training. It builds strength. It positively affects all the areas of your life. But if you want to be remembered, if you want to feel whole, and discover your own originality, writing is the next step.</p><p>Funny how most people completely change their behavior, when in front of someone rich, famous, or attractive. If you truly understand yourself, if you truly understand money, prestige, and desire, all you will see is another vulnerable fellow human being.</p><p>A few years ago, when I was still insecure, struggling in my life, one person trusted me. No ?compassion.? Just genuine interest. He told me, ?I?m looking forward to what you?re gonna accomplish in the future.? A few words from one person.

I agree. That?s why different people have completely different experiences abroad. Some grow. Others only grow more cynical. Life wants to give, but not everyone wishes to receive.</p><p>I?m not sure why anyone would infer this, but that?s definitely not the point, no. It?s about living a happy life, in a healthy body, with a sense of self-worth, and a global understanding of what?s going on with our manufactured desires.</p><p>That was sweet, thank you ! ???? Wishing you a great next decade, and a great life ! ????</p><p>If you grew up in a poor neighborhood, with parents struggling financially, indebted and not educated, you know why the poor stay poor: 1) climate of distrust (anger, threats, bullying) 2) lack of opportunities (no travel, no investment) 3) brain fog (cheap, unhealthy food)</p><p>Inspiration comes when you don?t seek it.

The soft spot in-between is often called ?awakening.?</p><p>?Don?t give up? doesn?t apply when you?re walking on the wrong paths: ? if you aren?t learning every day ? if you hate what you?re doing ? if you will be ?average? at most, when you could be ?great? elsewhere ? if you wake up miserable every day ? if your creativity is dying</p><p>As always, you have nature and nurture components, but a sustained radical change of environment often does the trick.

If you never built a product, you don?t realize the importance of execution when it comes to success. Doing is the fastest way to understand both yourself and society.</p><p>Every time you have a great idea, write it down, have a good night of sleep, read it the following day, discover it wasn?t so great.</p><p>A great book should be the snapshot of a great mind, not the highly curated mess of an average mind. Patience. Build your mind first.</p><p>That?s a big chunk of my book, from the lense of my own journey ??</p><p>I had never noticed many areas of my own mind and behavior until I completely changed my environment, language, culture, and habits. Once noticed, i unlearnt what I didn?t want, i learnt what I wanted, and I became who I wanted to become. Above my expectations for many areas.</p><p>From friends: ? neglecting health (sleep, work out) ? scattered, not meaningful friendships ? time wasted on the unneeded ? little initiative on the needed ? missed opportunities because ?later? ? not standing up for their principles ? seeking culprits ? not smiling more</p><p>The 2020s are coming. What were your big mistakes in 2010s? Mine: ? not living abroad sooner ? not believing in myself ? living too much in my mind ? not writing everyday ? too much entertainment consumption ? wrong diet ? too anxious ? living through others? idea of success</p><p>You fail when you are scared of failing. You succeed when failing is a non-existent concept.</p><p>A conversation requires two clear minds, who left aside ego and hostility. When at least one side is uneducated, it?s called a waste of time. Don?t engage in wastes of time.</p><p>Ways to lose mind clarity: ? being busy ? being angry ? being scared ? being insulin resistant ? being famous ? being sleep-deprived</p><p>Life is hard for everyone, not because of society, but because of the human condition.</p><p>Keep doing what you thought you couldn?t do, until you can do what you couldn?t even think of.</p><p>Just learn one thing that few can do. ?It matters little what most can?t do, it doesn?t mean I can?t.? Once you understand that, you get fearless, you get bold, and you attract success.</p><p>Fix your diet, fix your body. Fix your education, fix your mind. Fix your values, fix your relationships.</p><p>If oracles and smart contracts work seamlessly with an open and decentralized financial platform, many traditional structures will be disrupted.

Everyone should stay flexible when it comes to learning.</p><p>The future is unpredictable, but imo: ? if you work in the media, start your independent channel. ? if you work in finance/insurance, get involved in crypto. ? if you work in marketing, focus on authenticity/transparency. ? if you are replaceable, invest in scarcer skills.</p><p>Some perspective: If you are 30 years old, your parents 60 years old, and you meet them once a year, you will, at most, only meet them ?30 more times.</p><p>I actually started doing this, but I realize I would never take the time to watch most videos again, and the videos would pile up. So I decided to immediately put any interesting anecdotes in written form. That?ll be my second book ????</p><p>To be successful, be interesting. To be interesting, learn.

Maybe you need to reorganize your mental library.</p><p>There are many good, smart, old people out there, who will die in the next few years, leaving nothing behind, even though the story of their lives could compete with the best epic poems.

We have the Internet now. What we need: Clear minds, independent thinkers, different perspectives. They aren?t acquired through a screen, but by experiencing a unique life.</p><p>The less you know, the more you rely on others. The more you rely on others, the more anxious you become. Solve ignorance through education. It leads to more self-reliance.

But somewhat, your worries from today, are important enough to prevent you, from spending time with whom you love, from doing what makes you feel alive, from standing up for your values. The smart don?t repeat mistakes.</p><p>You are not old at

You are not even old at 
You are old when you give up. Keep trying. Never stop learning. Grow till the very end.</p><p>They tell you its impossible. You listen to them. A decade later, you discover it was done by someone else. The art of regret.</p><p>To get value, create value. To get love, love others. To get respect, respect yourself.</p><p>The Internet is for learning.</p><p>A good relationship is based on trust. A good business is based on trust. A good life is based on trust. But as long as you don?t trust yourself, you won?t trust others, and others won?t trust you. And self-trust is an inner journey.</p><p>If your kids no longer trust you, the fault lies on you.

Wishing you all the best in your personal projects as well ! ????</p><p>If you find someone interesting, get in touch with them today. And keep it up. With no motivation.

No one is born with a clear mind. No one is born with courage. They are all acquired. Decades of efforts.

You can?t grow if you refuse to feel uncomfortable. You can?t hear what you refuse to listen.

How about you???</p><p>To become more interesting, surround yourself with people, not necessarily more intelligent or wiser than you, but with complete different perspectives.</p><p><span>I?d say: <a href="https://t.co/vWZFJVnMiD">https://t.co/vWZFJVnMiD</a></span></p><p>Mental health is linked to legs? health. You want ideas, walk more. You want more ideas, squat more. Sitting all day long kills creativity.</p><p>I once had a dream. I had lost someone really dear to me. I woke up in panic. A mere dream. Relieved. And yet, my uneasy feelings never left. All the people you love today, one day, probably unexpectedly, will be gone. Treasure them. Love them. Life is about people.</p><p>Eat less, you get healthier. Conform less, you get more interesting. Consume less, you get more creative. Fear less, you get happier.</p><p>Societal autophagy leading to a more antifragile civilization.</p><p>Your first relationship is messy. Your first journey abroad is messy. Your first personal work is messy. And it?s all right. Your mind learns from messiness.</p><p>When you look back on your life, what you will care about won?t be money, or attractiveness, or being right or wrong. You will care about your social impact, what you didn?t do out of fear, how meaningful your relationships were. Start building. Start creating. Start living.</p><p>At school, if you do exactly as you are told, spend a lot of time memorizing answers, say what teachers want to hear, you succeed. But in real life, your obedience, your efforts, your good memory, won?t guarantee any success. Too many seem to think life is like school.</p><p>If you aren?t building any creative skill,  start today. If you can be replaced, you will.</p><p>Don?t fake it till you make it. When you try to look cool, smart, or self-confident in front of smart people, you just appear immature, ignorant, and insecure. At least, be honest. The smart all value honesty, because it?s the prerequisite to learning.</p><p>Criticizing, easy. Making a positive impact, hard. Scapegoating, easy. Facing your own flaws, hard. Distrusting, easy. Loving, hard.</p><p>????</p><p>Most don?t lack talent, most are focused on the wrong things. Noticing the right things is the talent.</p><p>There?s no shortcut in life. Start today.</p><p>Life is unpredictable. Don?t be that guy, lost in the cycle of busyness, unable to spend time with their parents. Until one day, a sudden phone call. And they realize they won?t be able to talk, argue, or laugh together anymore. Parents are imperfect. But let?s be kind here.</p><p>Maybe you are wondering: if most people value good grades, prestigious institutions, high salaries, fame, over a lifetime of freedom, doing what they love, with whom they love, there must be a reason. And you would be right: they lack perspective, imagination, and courage.</p><p>Being constantly scared: of how you are perceived by others, of what you should say or not say, of not being able to silence your inner voice, of disappointing, yourself and others, of trying and failing, of looking stupid. Once you overcome it, you understand what focus is.</p><p>You dont win an argument, you just lose some life.</p><p><span>These worked well for me: <a href="https://t.co/jgea51N3fl">https://t.co/jgea51N3fl</a></span></p><p>Your full potential is unlocked once you lock away your anxiety.</p><p>I couldn?t focus properly when my lifestyle was a mess; and some long-term relationships are what gave me the opportunity to change everything.

But remaining so is a choice. Everyone talented you see, went from mediocre to average, from average to good, from good to great, from great to recognized. Each transition takes years. All you need is not give up.</p><p>Everyone wants to believe they can rely on their intuition. Intuition is cultivated through a lifetime of discipline and efforts. Most people let theirs die through monotony and complacency. Think of grandmaster chess players: their intuition results from decades of practice.</p><p>If you struggled at school, it means that sitting for hours a day, passively listening to what they think you should memorize, whilst mechanically taking notes, isn?t your strong point. But fortunately,  success in life is about learning.</p><p>Thanks for the kind words ! ????</p><p>If every time you start thinking, you end up doing nothing, stop thinking, start doing. You want reasons to not do it, you will find some.</p><p>Most conversations lead to no growth, because people are busy listening to their own voice in their head.</p><p>Anyone can be better at communication: talk less, listen more, skip unneeded anecdotes, get to the point faster. Once you value their time,  they value your words.</p><p>A singer needs one song. A writer needs one book. An investor needs one investment. Any entrepreneur needs one product. Only one. A great one. Requiring years of disciplined efforts. The whole world will seemingly be against you. Until your vision becomes reality.</p><p>A common point between all the successful people around me: they never forget to reach out when they say they will. They are never too ?busy? to build long-term relationships: the latter is the reason of their success.</p><p>Be the one speaking at the conference. Be the one writing the book, the one directing the movie, the one singing the song. Be the one giving the lecture. Self-confidence is built through accumulation of personal achievements, not by looking at others building theirs.</p><p>Agreed!  maybe first, educating yourself on the world,  and what you could do to provide value that may get back to you in the future. Then, start doing: sooner or later, you end up around interesting people who also ?do.?  They tend to be optimistic: virtuous circle starting.</p><p>????</p><p>Nah, just start cultivating optimism, it opens up so many opportunities invisible to the pessimistic eyes. Our imagination is often scarier than the reality ??</p><p>Fastest way to convince someone: be financially independent, self-confident, with a clear mind, with skills that few have, and knowledgeable about what matters. Always easier to convince when your success doesn?t rely on them being convinced.</p><p>We focus too much on the scary that doesn?t happen. We forget the scary that?s happening: spending 40 years, indoors, barely seeing the sun, doing what we may dislike, with whom we may dislike. And for what? imaginary money, empty vacations, the wrong idea of happy retirement.</p><p>Next time you?re about to give up, remember many never had the chance to get started.</p><p>Recipe for talent: Choose something you love, spend four focused hours a day on it, keep it up for a few years. Recipe for wealth: Understand what you need and want, understand what people need and want, and become a trusted provider.</p><p>Happy people don?t spend their time attacking others: they?re busy learning.</p><p>You think you are smart when you overthink, but smart people don?t overthink. They think clearly, right, and only when needed.</p><p>To learn, be curious. To learn faster and deeper,  surround yourself with curious people who daringly ask questions.</p><p>Being optimistic is a superpower.</p><p>Thanks for the shoutout! And when it comes to leveraging Twitter, I?d advocate one step further: write everyday ?? Concise, clear, personal thoughts. Before you know it, years go by, and you realize you got what you wanted: a clear mind, fast and right.</p><p>The smart get smarter when they figure out how to silence the mind.</p><p>To get more interesting ideas, live a more interesting life. To live a more interesting life, do what most are scared to do. To do what most are scared to do, understand most fears are unjustified. To understand most fears are unjustified, stop living in your mind: just do it.</p><p>Before you get into any argument, ask yourself: is it worth the time and irritation? And even if you are ?right?, does proving someone wrong make you happier? If not, ignore and move on. Life will suddenly get better.</p><p>To be more attractive,  be more relaxed and self-confident. To be relaxed, avoid the insecure. For that: be financially independent. By providing value. To be self-confident, build a strong body and a clear mind. For that: spend a decade on educated efforts. Out of self-love.</p><p>People love you when you respect their time. Never show up late. Talk less to say more. Express your gratitude, provide value. They don?t owe you their attention. Never take it for granted.</p><p>Remember five years ago. If you had a long-term vision for today, a disciplined schedule, and understood the art of focus, you are probably way ahead of your most optimistic plans. Five years from now? Start pondering.</p><p>I forgot the most frequent one. ????</p><p>Don?t throw away anonymity for fame. Don?t throw away integrity for lust. Don?t throw away health for money. Some things can never be fixed. The short-lived thrill isn?t worth it.</p><p>I will write about it in my incoming first book, but imo, its simple but not easy: constant mindfulness. Just keep noticing everything: breath, thought, emotion, reaction, any sensation (heat, cold, pressure) etc. Day after day. Do it for a few years. One day, youre there.</p><p>If you are naturally anxious, learn about your body, your mind, and experiment different habits and diet. Spend years if needed. Your best achievements are yet to come. But you need to solve anxiety first.</p><p>When they see someone financially successful, they seek flaws. Maybe he is unattractive. Maybe he?s divorced. Maybe he isn?t smart. Maybe he?s a jerk. Maybe he?s depressed. And they feel better. The ?all-around perfect? good people are the most disliked by the unhappy.</p><p>I remember eight years ago, when I started martial arts. I remember four years ago, when I started to learn Japanese. I remember two years ago, when I started to write. Every time, I thought it was ?too late.? Start today. You will thank yourself.</p><p>I rely on my intuition built on thousands of people met during the past few years, but basically: they have this spark of curiosity in their eyes. They think clearly, and you understand after a few minutes of conversations that they are different.</p><p>Thank you for your kind words as well! ??</p><p>Don?t waste time arguing with people lacking the imagination to understand other perspectives.</p><p>To be successful, you need: ? imagination That?s it.</p><p>Only thing you need to be interesting? Curiosity. Only thing you need to grow? Self-honesty. Only thing you need to create value? The courage to be unique.</p><p>Don?t try to memorize. try to understand. Don?t try to be fast, try to be right. Don?t try to change others, try to change yourself. Don?t try to impress, try to learn.</p><p>Talk less, say more. Think less, do more. Eat less, move more. Worry less, focus more. Complain less, assist more. Demand less, offer more. Read less, apply more. Fear less, live more.</p><p>They give you what they made everyone to believe was valuable, money, which they can print at will; they take from you what they made everyone to believe was natural to sacrifice, time, which no one can renew.</p><p>The reason many dont invest more time in themselves: they are scared to discover they dont have the potential they wish they had. Most dont lack talent, most lack courage.</p><p>It doesn?t matter how fast you run if you are in the wrong direction. It doesn?t matter how high you jump if you break down on the landing. It doesn?t matter how rich you are if you have neither time nor health. It doesn?t matter how much you achieve if you are unhappy.</p><p>Underrated skill: Seeing people both as they are today and as they may be tomorrow. Start a relationship with the promising.</p><p>If you never struggle to understand what you read, you read too much entertainment.</p><p>The Internet is the best thing that happened to all the creative introverts.</p><p>To be less wrong, be wrong more often.</p><p>If you?re gonna be proud of something, it should be in your incoming future, not in your bygone past.</p><p>To think faster, clearer, and deeper, spend more time doing nothing.</p><p>If you are intelligent, but surrounded by the unintelligent, it?s easy to be angry. If you are intelligent, and surrounded by the intelligent, it?s easy to be happy. If you are unintelligent, you are always angry. If you are truly intelligent, you find the right people.</p><p>If you are rich and smart, you prefer people to think you?re poor. Pretending to be rich,  either a sign of poverty or stupidity.</p><p>The secret of reading others? minds: understanding yourself.</p><p>Thank you ! ????</p><p>You can have money and free time, and not figure out how your mind best learns. You can have neither, and still figure out how to not let your curiosity die whilst preparing to catch an opportunity. It really depends on everyone?s circumstances.

Trust more, you solve anxiety. Focus more, you solve envy.</p><p>Slow learning, lifelong growth.</p><p>To be happy, ignore what you don?t need to think of, and focus on what you need to do. Intelligence is the ability to clarify what you need from what you don?t.</p><p>You will disappoint if you?re scared of disappointing. You will look stupid if you?re scared of looking stupid. You will remain unloved if you?re scared of loving. Fears are self-fulfilling prophecies.</p><p>It?s probably not about age, but about the amount of concentrated efforts over a long period of time.

Stay patient: long-term, the kind, honest  respectful people will find you. And the best relationships will emerge.</p><p>Think of the happiest and most successful people you know. They have no idea whether they are ?gonna make it? in the next few years. Unpredictable things happen quickly.</p><p>Insecure people can?t help but point out their own insecurities in you.</p><p>When you are scared of looking stupid, you talk for the sake of talking, learn little, and actually become stupid. When you are not scared, you talk less, you listen, learn, and become smart.</p><p>Recipe for unhappiness: Living in the past you can?t change. Recipe for hope: Living in a future you can imagine.

You can?t understand depression if you?ve never been depressed. You can?t understand abusive relationships if you?ve never been through one. It?s easy to judge when everything is going well. You need skin in the game.</p><p>There is no love without commitment. There is no successful investment without conviction. There is no growth without risk-taking. When you act half-heartedly, you fail.</p><p>Intelligence is also the ability to stop constantly judging when you realize it makes you miserable.</p><p>Smart people treat children as adults.</p><p>Most fears disappear with the confidence that you can learn anything.</p><p>Some people are constantly tired because anger is very energy-consuming.</p><p>????</p><p>Fastest way to lose self-esteem: constantly paying attention to more successful, more attractive, more hard-working people.

Their every behavior becomes unauthentic. Like they?re wearing a mask. Long-term, they have no trustworthy and meaningful relationship, yet don?t understand why.</p><p>It?s like people working out, or doing some sort of sport, for years, with little progress: they need deeper focus, more efforts, more self-questioning, more humility. The best way to learn is ours to figure out.</p><p>If you read too much without thinking enough, you start believing the thoughts of others are your own.</p><p>Meaningful relationships start after you overcome loneliness alone.</p><p>Thank you for your kind words as well! ??</p><p>Big thanks for your kind words, they mean a lot to me! ??

Then you lose the discipline to learn, mindfulness becomes secondary, and bad decisions start compounding.

Two years may turn into five,  then into ten. Don?t let a ?temporary job to save money? become your whole life.</p><p>People fooled by their own mind give up before even trying. Smarter people understand that their mental limits are often illusions.</p><p>You understand yourself after you make the effort to understand others.</p><p>Children are the incarnation of curiosity and boldness, two traits that most adults should resuscitate. Only the ignorant make fun of children.</p><p>Pretending you understand something you don?t, because you don?t want to look ignorant, is how you ruin relationships with smart people. They value honesty, and won?t waste time with people they can?t trust.</p><p>On ?thinkers? and ?memorizers?: Memorizers are scared of discarding what took them years/decades to cram in. Thinkers couldn?t care less. They move fast, make mistakes, reflect, learn, grow, and are happy.

Smothering so much talent is nearly criminal. But it?s not too late. With English  the Internet, your education can finally start.</p><p>Smart people learn constantly. Smarter people unlearn consistently.</p><p>The more you learn and connect things, the deeper you understand the immensity of your ignorance. It?s scary. You feel overwhelmed. Relax. That?s normal.

If you have such people around you, know they are full of doubts,  and consider potential failure everyday. As a friend, the best thing you can do is give unconditional support.</p><p>Becoming a different person year after year is the ?natural? order of things. Be like a bamboo: Build solid foundations, then never stop growing.</p><p>Thanks for your perspective ! ?? If you think you don?t know enough about the non-fiction parts you want to write about, I guess you can surround yourself with people who do and learn about it. ????</p><p>If you crossed paths with an angry dog, miserable-looking,  barking ferociously, would you try to use reason? They don?t speak your language, and they would bite you before listening. Just get out of here. If it?s an angry person, smile and ignore. If it?s on Twitter, block.</p><p>Been working on several drafts with different starting points, but nothing screaming ?this is it? yet. Same process as most: I write. I edit. Sometimes, it gets better. Sometimes, it doesn?t. Will publish when fully satisfied. ?? May have two books, a fiction + a non-fiction.</p><p>If people around you don?t trust you, waste no time with words, just get results. The more visible the results, the more supportive they become.</p><p>Lack of humility stems from ignorance, lack of mind clarity from dishonesty, lack of kindness from unimaginativity.</p><p>You impress people when you dont try to impress.</p><p>Maybe you think youre a good swimmer, and you can help this drowning guy, so you swim ahead and hold onto him. But it turns out hes panicked, and is about to kill both of you. Thats often what happens with anger.</p><p>The reason I?m never scared of failing: right from the start, no one expected any success from me. But doing my own things, without external pressure, out of self-respect only, hasn?t been working so bad so far. Different people learn differently.</p><p>I think solving problems making others happier makes you happier as well. ?I?m not solving problems, I am accumulating delayed happiness.? ??</p><p>You want to be happy, think only when you need to.</p><p>I?m a ???? , right assumption ;)</p><p>Haha thanks man ! I?m grateful to have such kind people paying attention to my thoughts ?? Wishing you all the best to your personal projects as well ! ??</p><p>Well put.??</p><p>People always compare themselves with people the same age. Age doesn?t matter. If you practiced an art diligently since you were 5, or read a ton of books, or traveled and lived in many countries, you will be smarter at 20 than most. If you didn?t, be brave and start today.</p><p>When you are 15,  you think most 25-year-old adults have figured most things out.

I will ! ???????</p><p>You can lift weights, avoid sugar sleep properly fast intermittently walk outside,  get plenty of sun be attractive, smart, confident, rich with many achievements, meaningful relationships valuable work and still occasionally be depressed. So let?s be kind to each other???</p><p>People are way more careful with a brand new car than with a semi-wreck. They are way more respectful at the beginning of a relationship than after decades. They eat carelessly, work out improperly, sleep insufficiently, when they are already unhealthy. We are irrational.</p><p>Don?t just listen, sing. Don?t just watch, act. Don?t just read, write.

Take your life, change the perspective, you start an entirely different life.</p><p>First thing coming to mind is, show them you care about what they think, and not, for example, just them getting the ?right? answers.</p><p>As a teacher, you only need to ensure one thing: that kids remain curious and imaginative.</p><p>Learning is the lifelong process of filtering out the truths from the lies.</p><p>My thoughts exactly. :) You can be financially rich, but with really poor values.</p><p>Applicable examples: ? building a loving family ? learning a language ? building a business ? thinking independently ? raising kids into fine adults ? understanding your emotions</p><p>If it?s not difficult and complicated, maybe it?s not worth it.</p><p>You are rich when you can help for free.</p><p>Write for several years. Read your old notes. Wonder if you ever really wrote that. That?s how flawed our memories, and our perception of the reality, are.</p><p>The key to a clear mind is to stop piling up new information,  and start connecting what you already have in a smoother way.</p><p>Fastest way to understand society and your own psychology, is to undergo big changes. Go from poor to rich. From unfit to fit. From ignorant to knowledgeable. From fuzzy mind to clear mind. From insecure to self-confident. From angry to happy.</p><p>Too much time spent on: ? getting the attention of people who couldn?t care less ? living in our own minds ? worrying about the out of control ? hurting those who love us most</p><p>People constantly seeking conflicts don?t seem to realize that smart and kind people silently avoid them.</p><p>Fastest way to solve a personal problem: find people who have it too, and solve it for them.</p><p>If you are often anxious, discard the habit of reading strangers arguing on the Internet. Arguing yourself? Peak foolishness. Ignore and move on. Life is too short to make others miserable when you could make them joyful.</p><p>Over the long-term, if you can?t build relationships with happy, kind, and honest people, the problem is you.</p><p>??</p><p>If you give up today, in five or ten years, reality will find you, and introduce you to someone who became who you could have become, but didn?t, because you lacked the courage to be seen failing over and over until success.</p><p>Seems like youre being a great parent, keep it up, I wish you and your family all the best ! :)</p><p>If you have kids,  write letters for ?future them?. As many as possible, for when they are 5, 10, 15, 25, 35, 55, or even 
You will learn about yourself, and you will rest assured: a snapshot of your mind will guide them whenever they feel lost.</p><p>When an ounce of depression lurks out, I think of my grandfather, killed in a war started for stupid reasons, which he had to participate in because he was born at a certain time on a certain land ruled by certain people. My ?uncertain? future is scary? At least I have one.</p><p>A good thought exercise for gratitude: Imagine yourself growing up, but from the perspective of your mother.</p><p>No conversation is worth being led if not accompanied by mutual respect. Exchanging ideas shouldn?t stir anger. There are plenty of smart and happy people out there: make time for them, you get the benefit of learning, plus joy.</p><p>Not doing what yields no long-term value is a sign of intelligence.</p><p>Don?t ask for opinions if your decision is already made. Time seeking validation could be spent towards increasing chances of success.</p><p>The way someone writes tells you a lot about their values and their intelligence. The way someone talks tells you a lot about their life experience.</p><p>There is no love at first sight, no billion dollars unicorn built in a day, no perfect body built in a week, no genius mind built in a month. Don?t fall in love with a romantic idea.</p><p>Anxiety is untamed intelligence. A mind spending too much time in the wrong futures. Tamed intelligence is about being undistracted by the inevitable interferences. Focus is acquired, and once maintained long enough, you get a clear mind.</p><p>You suddenly discover hidden paths when you have no safety net. The survival instinct of creativity.</p><p>If you are scared of making mistakes, it?s because you don?t learn from them, which only happens if you act mechanically and mindlessly. If you focus hard, and mindfully think while you do, it may take years of blunders, they are never wasted.</p><p>Thank you ! ??</p><p>Consume ?? short-term, you get satisfaction, long-term, you get: ? anxiety ? low self-esteem ? envy Produce ??????? short-term, you feel like an idiot, long-term, you get: ? self-confidence ? focus ? discipline ? happiness</p><p>Smart  unwise people get irritated upon witnessing lack of ?common sense?. Smart  wise people see an opportunity to learn kindness  empathy.</p><p>Seeing so many people constantly blaming their parents for everything. They are as imperfect as you are. They grew up in a world scarce in information with many lies. Don?t focus on what they didn?t do for you, focus on what they did for you considering the tools they had.</p><p>Writing a letter to your parents is the fastest way to remind yourself of what you forgot to be grateful about.</p><p>All you need for lifelong learning: courage. It?s about taking the risk of breaking decades-long wrong beliefs. It?s about being open to new ideas that may marginalize you from most. Growing antifragile, being an independent thinker, they?re both synonyms for living happily.</p><p>Invest in people who will succeed. They are the people you barely recognize year after year. Constantly growing. But you won?t appreciate their value unless you are also growing yourself.</p><p>Seek attention, you get contempt. Seek results, you get attention. Seek respect, you get distrust. Seek kindness, you get respect. Seek happiness, you don?t get it. Seek others? happiness, you do.</p><p>That?s where the value is, combining your abilities in a unique way that society values. ?? But you?ll have to figure it out yourself, as no one knows you as well as you do.</p><p>Go to any hospital of the world. Many only have a few weeks to live. They know it. They are scared. But they?ve bravely learnt to accept it. You may have years or decades left. Are you going to do nothing, because it?s ?too late? compared to the success stories you read?</p><p>Coding apps. Drawing. Eloquence. Thinking clearly. Charisma / inspirational. Learning anything. Beating the odds.</p><p>It has to be something you love, otherwise, you?ll end up being unhappy. Following my definition of value: Singing. Writing. Making videos. Saving lives. (Surgeons, etc) Acting. Teaching. Job providing. Entertaining (sport, comedian, etc). Probably many more.</p><p>Value is when people come to you, and express their gratitude, because you helped them. Focus on value-creating skills, money will follow.</p><p>That?s why I?m overall bullish for mankind?s ability to innovate, if only wealth could be redistributed more efficiently, and knowledge spread more widely. Looks like we are on a good trend though.</p><p>Two types of people: Those busy solving problems of others, till they realize they solved their own. Those busy solving their own problems, who never seem to go anywhere. Life cares once you care for others.</p><p>Exactly, there?s a soft spot that is different for every kid. That?s why there?s no recipe for success: too many external factors that can lead to radically different reactions from kid to kid.</p><p>You either attract who you are, who you were,  as they become more like you, or who you will be,  as you become more like them.</p><p>Rather than a goal, I think they are a direct consequence, stemming from: ? self-confidence (which you get after overcoming difficult challenges) ? self-understanding (which you get with daily mindfulness) ? wisdom (which you get with lifelong learning)</p><p>The key to being likable is honesty, with a kind and cheerful personality, and a clear mind that never gets angry.</p><p>The best relationships are (nearly) effortless right from the start, and only get better through the years.</p><p>People prefer certainty of unhappiness over uncertainty of happiness.</p><p>Thank you so much for the kind words ! ????

Will check it out !</p><p>If you inspired at least one person to achieve more than they thought they could, your contribution to mankind already exceeds by far the average contribution. To all the great teachers, mentors, parents, writers, or artists of any sort, keep doing what you do best.</p><p>If you grew up in a household constantly worrying about money, your intellectual abilities were inhibited. You probably never traveled. Never went to any paid events. Ate cheap food, mostly carbohydrates. Constantly stressed. Your potential is yet to be discovered.</p><p>You can?t teach people the value of learning.</p><p>Thank you sir! ??</p><p>Every time you look up statistics, failed startups, failed careers, failed relationships, ask yourself if it?s about hedging risks, or about finding reasons to give up before even starting.</p><p>Talent is guided effort. Success is guided focus. Genius is guided freedom.</p><p>Life gets more fun once, every night upon going to bed, you have something to wake up for, that makes you do what you love, learn what you want to learn, help people you love.</p><p>Always try to imagine an answer before you google a question.</p><p>Unoriginal life, unoriginal content. You want to write a great book, live a great life first.</p><p>It?s impossible to be constantly physically and mentally healthy. You will have bad days. Bad periods of your life. During which, you will be treated the same way as you?ve been treating people. With judgment. With indifference. Or hopefully, with kindness.</p><p>The ignorant want to talk whenever they get one idea. What they don?t realize: the wiser only talk after discarding 99% of theirs.</p><p>Self-confidence is acquired after, at least once in your life, you successfully do what everyone around you told you was impossible.</p><p>You need to have been insecure and mentally weak to understand those who still are, but in order to help them, you need the strength to not be angry, to not revert back, whilst helping.</p><p>Cultivate courage when you don?t need it yet. Create meaningful relationships when you don?t need them yet. Learn about health when you are still healthy.</p><p>You want a happy couple, you need two self-loving individuals.</p><p>The Internet made the curious more knowledgeable, the ignorant more misinformed, the unfocused more depressed, and the smarter much smarter.</p><p>If you went through life-threatening hardships, write about it. You are helping yourself to never become careless again. You are helping many desperate people currently drowning in hopelessness.</p><p>People think they are smart because they think constantly, but intelligence is about figuring out how to stop thoughts that make you miserable.</p><p>Thank you ! ????</p><p>Expecting someone to come into your life and helping you build your dreams, is like trying to win the lottery: it can happen, but even if it does, you won?t acquire the self-esteem and self-confidence needed to live a happy life.</p><p>Idiots doing what they love are smarter than intellectuals doing what they hate.</p><p>Your life gets better once you focus on making the lives of others better.</p><p><span>Some thoughts here. I?d add it?s much more difficult, and requires more ?intelligence?, to not think than to think negatively. As in, mindful doing with no parasitic thoughts. <a href="https://t.co/MY2U6mFA5A">https://t.co/MY2U6mFA5A</a></span></p><p>I think people who think a lot assume they are smart. In my definition of ?intelligence?, I include the ability to figure out how to put into practice knowledge in order to live happily. The higher levels of intelligence involve doing, not thinking, especially not with words.</p><p>Could you elaborate? ?? My thoughts aren?t supposed to be ?truths?, I?m pretty sure I can find counter points to every single one of them, so I?m always happy to get constructive  respectful feedback ??</p><p>Reminder that today, just like five years ago, just like ten years ago, you think you?ve figured everything out, but again, you will be proven wrong by your future self.

I have no idea when I will be satisfied enough to publish it, but hopefully, you will be as well: thank you for your patience ???????</p><p>For book recommendations: It?s complicated. What you need to read depends on what your life circumstances made you blind to. Mindfulness, nutrition, money were what I needed to understand to go from zero to one but history, science, philosophy, fitness, love are fundamental.</p><p>The less you have achieved, the less value you have given people, the less fulfilling of a life you have led, the more you fear death.</p><p>Sit down, type words, re-read, delete when it?s bad, and reiterate months after months. The struggle is part of the learning process.</p><p>Suppose you luck out, and a company hires, or a person chooses, ?the person you pretended to be.? Doomed to fail. Everyday becomes a struggle, trying to keep up with the appearance. They are disappointed, you are unhappy. Take your time, become who you want to be first.</p><p>The way you walk reflects your self-confidence. Your relationships reflects your self-esteem. Your skin reflects your nutrition and lifestyle. The depth of your thoughts reflects the quality of your life.</p><p>A few years ago, when I was unhappy and resentful, I could remember the details of a conversation a week later. Today, after thirty minutes, I barely remember what I said earlier. I have no recipe for happiness, but for unhappiness, it?s definitely clinging to the past.</p><p>Reading is how you get less ignorant. Writing is how you get smarter.</p><p>Too much time doing the wrong things, not enough doing nothing, and you get both problems and anxiety.</p><p>Thanks for the kind words ! ????</p><p>You read less once you understand the value of writing your own thoughts. Fulfillment doesn?t come from consumption, but from creation.</p><p>Write them down consistently,  things will clear up.</p><p>Allow yourself more time to think and you will have more interesting thoughts.</p><p>Magic is illusion,  technology is real. Manipulation is illusion, honest clear mind is real. Money is illusion, value is real.</p><p>It?s difficult, but the desire to change already sets you on the right direction. Start with mindfulness. There are many reasons for anger, sometimes subconscious. They can be related to health. Self-esteem and self-confidence issues. Too little time doing what you love.</p><p>If you truly do it for yourself, you won?t bother telling anyone else. Read for yourself, not to engage in vanity metrics, especially if you can barely explain in your own words the newly acquired ideas.</p><p>Regardless of how you rationalize it, angry and insecure people around you are huge in costs:  emotional, mental, overall peace. You want to deeply focus, get rid of unneeded relationships first.</p><p>Maybe you need more time to learn than most because you have more to connect.</p><p>The secret to having great insights: hanging out with both extremely intelligent and extremely unintelligent minds.</p><p>Every time you feel irritated by general criticism, you have an opportunity to fix an insecurity.</p><p>If you think everyone is constantly judging you, learn how to stop judging.</p><p>Life is like a game of tennis. Up to a certain level, you can win most games by minimizing mistakes.</p><p>Playful learning, deepest learning.</p><p>A misconception: Smart people being ?lazy.? They just dislike working in inefficient ways  favor the long-term over the short-term. You won?t find any ?lazy genius? without a disciplined routine. They may look like they?re slacking off. But remember: thinking is invisible.</p><p>If a sentence can be shortened, it should be. The perk of being around smart and happy people: they will still read between the lines, the right way.</p><p>Don?t be flustered to miss a train and ?lose 15 minutes?, when you willingly throw away the best years of your life ?because it?s stable.?</p><p>Two people in the same environment get different reactions. Two people in the same conversation get different thoughts. Two people reading the same book get different lessons. The better you already understand, the more you will understand.</p><p>You don?t get things done by paying attention to others getting things done.</p><p>Smart people figure out how to be fit, healthy, with a clear skin, and a good posture. They figure out how to be funny, interesting, self-confident, and overall happy. You will be more attractive once you are smarter.</p><p>Read it several times, a great book will always be great. Listen to it several times, a great song will always be great. Watch it several times, a great movie will always be great. Great is timeless.</p><p>Thanks for your kind words ! ??????</p><p>Lifting weights lifts you out of anxiety. Pushing your limits pushes you outside the low self-esteem zone. Pulling others up pulls yourself up.</p><p>Relationships work better when people are just honest to each other, instead of playing mind games. You like someone?  Go tell them  start building something.</p><p>You are always wrong to expect attention.</p><p>You don?t need motivation, you need self-love.</p><p>Happy people never seek validation.</p><p>Learn about yourself, tame your fears, understand your desires, learn about the world, go out there, take risks, meet people, seek to help and create value, and before you know it,  you are in a positive loop.</p><p>You want more interesting ideas, live a more interesting life.</p><p>If things don?t seem to connect, read a lot more from clearer minds, think a lot more with smarter minds, do it for a lot longer with deeper focus, and before you know it, the imposter syndrome will be gone.</p><p>Angry and ignorant are the same word. And so are kind and brave.</p><p>Too much time spent on the impossible that feels possible, like what people think of you, like living life according to plan; not enough time spent on the possible that feels impossible, like never stopping to learn, like loving yourself.</p><p>Agreed !  The sweet spot itself is to be readjusted depending on your current stage of life. Sometimes, you want to ?dive in? when you have a glimpse of insight down there. That?s why writing is so important: to less subjectively keep track of our evolution.</p><p>You won?t help your anxious friends by being anxious. You won?t help your poor family by being poor. You won?t help the ignorant by being ignorant. Elevate yourself,  ensure your safety, then help around.</p><p>Appreciation of long-term investment cannot be taught. When you?ve never committed for a decade, you?re blind to compounded value. Think of the happiest people. They attained ?mastery? over at least one something. Company. Love. Craft. Physical performance. Clear mind.</p><p>You start becoming more unique once you stop thinking of yourself as unique.</p><p>When you catch yourself judging someone remember you don?t know their past or their parents?, or grandparents?, and also, that not everyone had an equal access to a good education.</p><p>We project ourselves. The liar sees trickery everywhere the stagnant is blind to others? change the gossiper worries about reputation. But similarly the kind notices invisible acts of kindness the loving appreciates the beauty of life the honest is offered peace  clarity.</p><p>You know you are successful when people scrutinize your mistakes.</p><p>It?s not just about age, it?s about how deeply focused you were. Someone spending a lifetime in passivity learns less than a 20-year-old who kept learning out of sheer curiosity.</p><p>Completely. I have plenty of acquaintances who hardly make the time to walk or exercise at all. I admire their ability to keep their sanity.</p><p>If you struggle to think of new ideas,  consume less from others? minds, and dig harder in your own mind.</p><p>Life gets fun once irritation is no longer your default state.</p><p>Books are great to avoid mistakes. Learn about money, avoid enslaving yourself with an irresponsible debt. Learn about food, avoid eating what causes inflammation and depression. Learn about principles, avoid screwing up all your relationships. But then, don?t forget to live.</p><p>Some people seem ?scared? of learning. Because in the process, they may discover they have been doing something wrong for decades. Imo, people who have overcome this fear are all avid learners and big risk takers. They are the commonly portrayed ?successful entrepreneurs?.</p><p>People don?t want the truth, they want to avoid the pain of regrets.</p><p>People who are not who they want to be will dislike you for becoming who you want to be.</p><p>A breakthrough is a moment of clarity embedded within a routine of clarity, so you better not rely on luck.</p><p>Don?t mistake what you want to do and what you think you should do.</p><p>Indeed! Whether you invest time or money,  success always seems to be about feeling the potential growth, and also not getting too emotionally attached.</p><p>Most ideas you have are worthless, but it may take a while before you notice it.</p><p>What you think you cannot do doesn?t matter, what you don?t do does.</p><p>If you aren?t hungry, don?t eat. If you can?t trust someone, stay away. If you want money, create value.</p><p>You don?t need a formal education to change the world, only a creative mind.</p><p>Because you may be teaching each other a foreign language. I agree that most social gatherings are often a ?waste? of time, or at least, an opportunity cost, and they are usually not where you end up building the most meaningful relationships.</p><p>Not at all my intention, there?s nothing wrong with that. All the smartest people I know tend to be a little reserved. It?s just too bad that those who have the most interesting things to say stay silent, sometimes merely because of a lack of self-confidence.</p><p>You think you are ?introvert?? ?Shy?? ?Socially awkward?? Try this: Every week, go out twice. Talk to 5 strangers.30 minutes each. 2.5 hours. 10 people a week.520 people a year.1040 people in two years. Let me know if you still think you?re shy.</p><p>I?ve been pondering a bunch of titles, but nothing fully satisfying and definitive so far. I may create a poll  ask for suggestions when the time comes ??</p><p>Lots of people aren?t exchanging ideas in order to learn, they successively wait for their turn to talk and rehearse what they memorized. The greatest thinkers adjust their pace, and seek to teach and be understood, not to show off out of ego.</p><p>The smaller your contribution to society, the bigger the echo of your ego.</p><p>Unfortunately, nop. Deleted my personal FB, inactive on all the others. Managing several of them feels like a chore to optimize reach  financial gains, which are the least of my concerns: I mainly write for myself  already feel very grateful for my audience on Twitter ??</p><p>Am applying the same philosophy for my ongoing book. Won?t publish it until I?m fully satisfied, and I?m fairly harsh with myself. I intend to prove: ?Slow writing, highest value.?</p><p>Don?t be scared of getting an idea stolen (1) it forces you to come up with new ideas constantly  creativity is a muscle (2) it?s about implementation (3) someone else who doesn?t care about financial gains will disclose it anyway</p><p>It rarely sticks when you learn something the easy way anyway. ;)</p><p>Met someone smart six months ago, met them today, and they feel different? That?s normal. Intelligence is in the ability to learn, to constantly update oneself, to evolve into a better person. If their presence makes you uncomfortable, maybe you aren?t growing.</p><p>Yup! Do something mindfully, diligently, with passion, for a decade or more, and you finally understand what Einstein meant by ?compound interest is the eight wonder of the world.?</p><p>It takes years to build a great company. Even decades for the greatest. Hopping around for quick gains makes you miss on significant value. Talent follows the same rule. And meaningful relationships as well.</p><p>Anxiety goes away once you stop paying attention to the growth of others, and focus on your own instead.</p><p>That?s called peer pressure-induced stress. ??</p><p>Mindfulness is like having a great teacher at your side. It makes every single learning experience more fun.</p><p>That?s cute ??</p><p>Slow reading, most enjoyable reading. Slow learning, deepest understanding. Slow to conclusions, deepest thinking. Rushing can make you waste time  life.</p><p>Thank you for the kind words as well ??</p><p>Stay true to your principles, be honest in all circumstances, and not only anxiety disappears, but you are rewarded with a clear mind.</p><p>Because life is too short,  and there are enough great people out there, who are happy, kind, honest, optimistic, respectful, smart, to not spend time arguing with people who make you unhappy. There?s always a way to grow AND having a good time.</p><p>A counterintuitive principle that has improved my life: If it?s easy, don?t do it. Applicable to many areas, from working out, to reading books, or building something. For relationships though, if it doesn?t feel effortless, I quickly discard them.</p><p>The harder is often also the more valuable. ??</p><p>I think the bigger your Twitter account, the quicker to block you become. If I started to pay attention to all the angry / cynical / ad hominem / disrespectful comments, I?d quickly grow resentful of society imo. ?? Also, everyone has bad days, don?t take it personally. ??</p><p>If general criticism hurts your personal feelings,  keep stress-testing your beliefs keep inquiring on the nature of thoughts until you break the mental shackles that subconsciously made you miserable.</p><p>You can?t schedule moments of happiness.</p><p>The richer you are, the less flustered by the small things you are. Constant irritation is a habit of the poor.</p><p>You can?t appreciate others? creativity if you have never created.</p><p>No need to be a genius to provide value: you just need a perspective that few have because you lived a life that most were too scared to even attempt.</p><p>The happy have no incentive to argue with the unhappy. The wise have no incentive to argue with the unwise. The intelligent have no incentive to argue with the unintelligent. You want better relationships, become a better person first.</p><p>If you want to link everything to luck, you will find a way. I would rather put an emphasis on what you can actually control to a certain extent.

Until one day,  some of your decisions yield all the gains. Humble people call it luck.</p><p>Truly successful people want as many people to succeed as possible, because they understand they?re better off with a society of self-loving people.</p><p>Unjustified optimism still takes you further than justified pessimism.</p><p>I personally don?t remember any of my important thoughts at the end of the day, I always write everything potentially valuable right away.</p><p>If your partner were to behave exactly according to your expectations you would quickly be bored. You want someone high in integrity, who shares your values, but who thinks and act differently,  in a positively surprising way. Everyday becomes mutual discovery and learning.</p><p>Don?t seek charisma, influence, or persuasive skills, seek authenticity and self-understanding. The former stems from the latter.</p><p>The effort of being constantly mindful is probably the fastest way. I say ?effort?, because we tend to be lazy at the beginning, but that?s one of the best feelings to have, accompanied with a clear  knowledgeable mind. Journaling probably also helps, but it depends on people.</p><p>Personal experience. I have a very stable routine when it comes to work out/nutrition. When I notice any difference in my overall status, I take mental notes. Anxiety has been correlated with too much coffee and black/green tea the same day. Lack of sleep is another reason.</p><p>Before diagnosing yourself with anxiety disorder, try to: ? cut down on caffeine ? get &amp;gt;30 minutes of sun/day ? reduce your sugar intake to zero ? lift several times/week ? help people around you ? have long-term goals (&amp;gt;years) May sound obvious, but hasn?t always been for me.</p><p>Most people did.

For the longer term, you want: - meaningful relationships - meaningful work - a healthy body, a clear mind - money to buy time to nurture creativity - kids  grandkids to understand life</p><p>If general criticism feels like personal attack, and you can?t move on without expressing your outrage because your whole identity is linked to a set of ideas and beliefs, you absolutely need education.</p><p>You don?t learn psychology from books,  but from meeting a wide range of people with completely different backgrounds and cultures, and taking notice of the patterns.</p><p>If you can?t sleep because of your thoughts, you don?t understand meditation yet.</p><p>If you consistently underperform, you overestimate your intelligence.</p><p>The path towards looking smart makes you stupid. The path towards being smart makes you feel stupid.</p><p>The more you care about ?being right?, the more likely you?ve missed the whole point of learning. It?s not supposed to bring anxiety, irritation or pride. It?s supposed to bring self-love, intellectual fulfillment, and peace.</p><p>Think of your greatest achievement so far, and start working towards another that should dwarf it in a decade.</p><p>When someone is trying to convince you about how great their life is, it?s not. A happy person never seeks validation.</p><p>If you cant find the motivation to work harder, its because you dont understand what you are doing with your life. Dont blame yourself. Society is full of deception. You were misguided. Correct your trajectory with the art of learning.</p><p>Some people spend their time plotting against other people, happy people spend theirs plotting against the miserable version of themselves.</p><p>If your kids grow up into anxious and angry adults, it?s because you were.</p><p>As long as you are unhappy, regardless of your features, you won?t be attractive to the right people.</p><p>Thank you! I?m writing the book I wish I could have read  years ago, but I won?t publish it until I?m fully satisfied. ??</p><p>Once you know most people are on a wrong direction, no more reason to get flustered about them running faster than you.</p><p>Agreed, there is a subtle balance to reach. Results are what matter in the end. You never know for sure whether it is procrastination or delayed gratification, because both can be effortful. Up to everyone?s good judgment, which always includes a huge luck component as well.</p><p>Delayed gratification is the best gratification. Especially when they are in years.</p><p>If you think you can be talented with no discipline, you are living in the idea of being talented.</p><p>It didn?t take Newton only ?two years of private studies? to invent calculus, just like it didn?t take Einstein only ?one year of miracles? to reinvent physics. It took them more than two decades of discipline, curiosity and growth. Valuable minds are built, not miraculous.</p><p>When you buy books, you exchange money against value.</p><p>If you don?t want children because you are scared of not being a good parent, you will be a better parent than most.</p><p>It takes courage to admit you?ve been wrong for decades, only fools feel embarrassed upon being heroic.</p><p>Many talk about ?North Korea? as if it was a single evil entity. You were born at a random time at a random place on Earth. Your ancestors decided to divide land into squares. They are ruled by a few individuals. Everyone is a victim. Scapegoating is the weapon of the weak.</p><p>The greatest scientists are always philosophers; the reciprocal isn?t true.</p><p>Thanks for the kind words! ????</p><p>Then, a lot of my close friends asked me to write a book. But I wasn?t confident in my English. So I started to write regularly on Twitter. And here we are... thank you all for your support! ??</p><p>That being said, the desire to help also gets you very far. All my knowledge when it comes to finance, fitness, and mental health, started because I wanted to help my parents who were endebted, unfit and constantly angry.</p><p>If you know a way to help people, allowing you to constantly learn,  and patiently grow your talents, do it. Until then, help yourself.</p><p>To have smart kids, be a smart parent.</p><p>In the future hopefully, when everyone gets equal access to a real education.</p><p>?No wise man ever wished to be younger.? ? Jonathan Swift</p><p>(I?m not trying to be cryptic here, that?s the clearest way I found to write it, hope you get the ?feel?.)</p><p>It?s like happiness. You can?t learn it with words. It?s something you need to live. It?s something that fills you with love for everything.</p><p>Because we live in a society where people don?t understand why they want what they want, the way is the process of self-understanding, until it becomes clear that what you want is rarely what you need. And what you need can only be understood by living meaningfully.</p><p>Too many books to read in a lifetime, too many people to meet in a lifetime, too many arts to learn in a lifetime: success is the art of choosing  not what you want,  not what you can,  but what you need.</p><p>You know you still grow when,  at any time of your life,  whenever you look back on a former version of yourself, you wonder how you could be such a jerk.</p><p>No one smart chooses to be constantly angry.</p><p>Thanks man ! ??</p><p>Thank you! Just trying to give back a little of what I got lucky to get, at my scale. Doing it entirely for myself, so I?m happy if my tweets can be of any help ??</p><p>And you are right to live authentically, according to your principles. Guilt appears when you don?t. ??</p><p>That being said, I know how difficult it is to even know where to start when you are completely lost. Because people around you are likely completely lost as well. That?s part of the reason I write my book, which is what I wish I could have read a few years ago.</p><p>In the end, it?s up to your judgment  how much it burdens you personally. Spent most of my life in a mimetic state of constant anger/cynicism.  Never provided any value to anyone back then. The Internet allows anyone who wants to become a better themselves to do so already.</p><p>Depending on their cultural background, people have different sensibilities, and entirely different concepts of respect. A habit that greatly improved my life: Someone angry? Smile and ignore. Value your time, and you will meet more valuable people.</p><p>Imagine you are in a boat. Water is leaking in. A few hours left before drowning. But all you do is repeat ?I?ll die.? That?s self-victimization.</p><p>The more intelligent, the fewer blames.</p><p>You learn about the true nature of a man when things don?t go according to plan.</p><p>You are happiest when you completely forget about happiness.</p><p>You will get a great learning experience either way.</p><p>Life is no longer school. You won?t impress by being faster. You will impress by being right. Focus on thinking clearer: thinking faster will be a direct consequence.</p><p>The less you rely on luck, the luckier you become.</p><p>Giving someone financial independence, is the fastest way to learn about their values, their intelligence, their creativity, and their self-esteem.</p><p>Barely 200 years ago, a theory of electromagnetism, major pillar of our interconnected world, had yet to be found. The world we?ll live in 50 years from now, is unimaginable today. Retirement? Foolish thought. Cultivating a flexible mind able to learn anything? Probably wise.</p><p>Don?t get lost in the world of theory.</p><p>Learning isn?t fun if the core of your knowledge is fragile. It?s solid only if memorization is an effortless byproduct of thinking. Mindfulness is how you rebuild your broken framework of self-understanding. Growth can finally start. The beginning of a more fun life.</p><p>To be interesting, be interested.</p><p>Start a company if you think you can provide value to people, not because you want to label yourself entrepreneur.</p><p>If you think you deserve no more than worthless relationships, question your self-esteem.</p><p>Promiscuity won?t teach you self-love.</p><p>Worry is ignorance. Patience is intelligence. It always takes more time than you think.</p><p>The fewer words required, the deeper the understanding.</p><p>No word can hurt the healthy mind.</p><p>If you want to create something, do it according to your vision first, feedback comes much later. Trying to satisfy everyone mid-process leads nowhere.</p><p>People like the idea of geniuses,  who could learn anything in a week, who will cure diabetes, depression  any cancer in the next few years, while solving Millenium problems and studying Russian + Chinese as hobbies. Wake up. Take care of yourself. No one will save you.</p><p>If you want to agree with everything you read,  write your own book, and even then, you will have disagreements after a few years.</p><p>Anything valuable takes years to learn.</p><p>I think weak human beings full of insecurities instinctively target what they consider easy preys. Same case as bullying. Once you have noticed that, you can elevate yourself in all the dimensions of life. Physically, mentally, spiritually, and suddenly, they are scared of you.</p><p>It?s hard to break out from the vicious circle of an education based on fear and lies, that probably started several generations ago.</p><p>Yes, the story of Helen Keller is inspirational. ??</p><p>If your relationship with your parents is a friendship based on trust and honesty, you are lucky. For many, it?s an authoritative hierarchical relationship.</p><p>I guess we all see ourselves through once we start listening to our insecurities.</p><p>It depends, but we can value respect with the amount of time we think was required, and ASAP can signal: i dont even take the time to communicate properly, hence, a sign of disrespect. In Japan, everyone would univocally say its rude, no question here.</p><p>Also another reason why I wish to write my book now, I?ll have forgotten most of my old ?feelings? in a few years, and I believe the value I can provide to people is in my experience of the transition.</p><p>I just know that when I didn?t like myself, I was anxious when looking at people, I?m now wondering what the fuss was about.</p><p>When you are afraid of looking at people in the eyes, you are actually afraid of looking at yourself.</p><p>If seeing a happy couple triggers envy,  you are not in a happy relationship, with your partner, yourself, or both.</p><p>There are two types of people, those who understand the miracle of language and books, and leverage it to avoid repeating common mistakes, and those who are unhappy.</p><p>People are often quick to disregard what they haven?t done themselves.</p><p><span>Similarly: <a href="https://t.co/ohfrZMR55e">https://t.co/ohfrZMR55e</a></span></p><p>It?s more about mindfulness than overthinking: a way to ruin relationships is by acting unauthentically indeed. All my relationships are with people who share similar views when it comes to what is ?valuable?, and they are nearly effortless: I?m just being mindfully myself.</p><p>Great habit to build meaningful relationships: when you are about to say something,  ask yourself if they need to know it. People naturally respect you when you respect their attention.</p><p>Try to do everything,  and you do nothing. Try to please everyone, and you please no one. Try to live the perfect life,  and you live a miserable life.</p><p>Deciding to spend time alone is a superpower, mother of talent.</p><p>If year after year, you wonder how your past self could be so clueless, keep going.</p><p>No amount of podcasts will replace a deep conversation you participate in; no amount of books will replace actually writing down your own thoughts. Active learning is more fun, but also a whole lot more efficient.</p><p>The more I think about language itself, the more I wonder about how we can even communicate at all. And our whole society is somewhat thriving on this miracle, alongside with a bunch of other forces which are there just because, which we are learning to use because ?desires? ??</p><p>Always keep in mind that no one has a clue about what they are doing.</p><p>Genius, contrarian, weird, and crazy, all refer to the same idea, but we choose depending on the results.</p><p>Imagine you now have youth,  money, great parents  friends, your ideal partner, your ideal of face and body, health, smart kids who love you, time for your passions, wits, mindfulness, self-love, and a purpose. Even then, envy will still be there. Don?t choose to be miserable.</p><p>Anxiety mostly stems from too much time as a witness of the success of others.</p><p>Plenty of truths in fictions, plenty of lies in non-fictions.</p><p>What you acquire with money is never as gratifying as what you acquire with efforts.</p><p>Keep surprising others, you will earn love and gratitude, keep surprising yourself, you will earn self-love and growth.</p><p>If you read without ever wondering how it relates to your life, you waste your time.</p><p>If you still hear your inner voice, you are not focused yet.</p><p>I think I?ll be too busy to think as much as I do now, so I?m writing my principles / self-given advice before I do ?? I?ve got the chance to discuss deeply with lots of parents, with successful  less successful kids, studied biographies of many great minds  that?s my take ??</p><p>You learn you can learn more than you think you can, by finding an activity you love, diligently practice every day for several years, and witness your growth. Self-confidence acquired from one success spreads onto all the other areas.</p><p>If you want to inhibit kids? growth, keep telling them they are smart. If you want to give compliments and nurture growth, praise their curiosity and efforts.</p><p>Life is a game of filling your gaps of knowledge, and you earn self-love as you go.</p><p>Never heard ?are you calling me stupid?? from an intelligent mind.</p><p>Relationships, investments, building value, learning deeply, most people fail, not because they are stupid, but because of short-term thinking.</p><p>Lack of sleep doesn?t mean more quality work or better judgment. It means ignorance of biological needs and blindness to higher order effects. You are likely neither helping yourself nor anybody else.</p><p>The thought ?I?m intelligent? comes from the unintelligent side of the mind.</p><p>Don?t pay attention to what you can learn nothing from. Success is about filtering through noise. Not applicable to your life? Ignore.</p><p><span>A long story; doing my best to summarize it in an entertaining and educative way. I?ll make an announcement once it?s published; you can stay updated here ?? <a href="https://t.co/1rpPaBQFff">https://t.co/1rpPaBQFff</a></span></p><p>Six years ago,  I was struggling to learn English. Fluency in Japanese? Pipe dream. Constantly exhausted, irritated, anxious. Couldn?t build a muscular body, fuzzy mind, full of wrong beliefs. Today, I?m writing a book about my experience. You can do way more than you think.</p><p>If you grew up in a poor family,  with uneducated parents, with average schools by default, with no networking, lost for most of your life, but you didn?t give up, and decided to leverage the Internet, and learn,  and grow every day, you are a miracle. Keep going ??</p><p>At school, you succeed if you learn fast. In life, you succeed if you learn correctly.</p><p>Life gets better once you realize there is no past, only your mind, and you mistaking yourself for it.</p><p>And even when we?ve been through rough times, we tend to have a short memory.</p><p>It?s difficult to go from zero to one, but n to zero is easy, and can happen anytime: when you lose your health.</p><p>You will find the right person once you have become the right person. Look inside, not outside.</p><p>People who never doubt about whether they are wasting their time, are more likely to waste their life.</p><p>Happy people are busy providing value for others, unhappy people think arguing over who is right and wrong builds value. The only criteria: If people come to you expressing their gratitude, you have built value.</p><p>The best relationships: two intelligent minds who only talk when they provide value to each other.</p><p>Quick-fix when you feel down: Get some sun and hit the gym. Long-term fix: Do it everyday. We all know what we need to do, but excuses are the path of least resistance.</p><p>Anger disappears once you truly take the time to understand one?s circumstances.</p><p>A clear mind is the most sustainable state of happiness.</p><p>People struggling to build anything valuable don?t necessarily lack intelligence or creativity, but maybe empathy and love. The desire to help others ?for free?, which leads to learning and teaching, develops the self-confidence  optimism fueling the rocket of success.</p><p>Genius is just unscheduled constant learning from everything.</p><p>The more you know, the more you value your time.</p><p>It wasnt, but thanks for the laugh :)</p><p>First you leave because you need a more stable environment to grow, then you leave because you need a more chaotic environment to grow.</p><p>If you read for the second time a book you loved a few years ago, but it doesn?t feel widely different, you should question your growth. It also applies to songs and movies.</p><p>Two types of people:1) those who don?t do it because it?s hard2) those who do it because it?s hard Long-term consequences:1) is low self-esteem, unfit, angry, anxious, conflicted, distrustful2) is happy, self-loving, w/ a healthy body, a clear mind, meaningful relationships</p><p>Was gonna say surround yourself w/ kind and honest people, but that?s a chicken  egg problem, because they avoid angry people. I think finding something you truly love doing, becoming focused on it, and great at it, will build self-love. Suddenly, things will look brighter. ??</p><p>The smartest people are humbled by the understanding of their ignorance.</p><p>Staying away from noise. Staying away from the nitpickers, the cynical, the outraged, the gossiper. Being mindful enough to not become one yourself. And allocating some time alone to yourself, working on some creative task everyday.</p><p>Anything you like, just keep increasing the difficulty.</p><p>You find reasons to be angry with others when you are angry with yourself.</p><p>Getting rid of anxiety ? The recipe Fast the body, reduce inflammation Fast the mind, reduce anger Find a goal greater than yourself, focus Lift, grow a self-confident body Read  write, grow a clear mind Spend time with kind  honest people Be mindful Everyday. That?s all. ??</p><p>If you don?t plan to do it seriously, don?t do it at all.</p><p>You just need to enjoy feeling stupid, and you will grow smarter much faster.</p><p>The most interesting people I?ve met, as in ?unique? in the way they think, have all been through a painful past. Bullying, deceased loved ones, near-death experience/disease... Beautiful minds fall into the darkness, but bravely swim out, and then keep shining with optimism.</p><p>As insignificant as they might be, if you don?t progress at least a little bit towards your goals everyday, you are not serious about wanting to be happy.</p><p>Nothing you consume can provide the long term satisfaction brought by one personal creation.</p><p>The best use of money is time to understand how your mind works.</p><p>Start with scientists who revolutionized society, but don?t forget poets and novelists who can fuel imagination, and philosophers who tinker about tinkering. Just never forget to have fun.</p><p>Books accelerate the learning process, but they won?t teach you how to think, or how to write, or how to be mindful, or how to build a successful business, or a loving family, or an athletic body. Dive into the complexity of the reality: happiness is about doing and growing.</p><p>Travel all you wish until you no longer  care about traveling. Meet as many different people as you wish until you prefer time spent alone. Try as many different hobbies as possible until you want to focus. Broaden your perspectives first, and the better choices will appear.</p><p>Thank you for the kind message! ??</p><p>Learn to appreciate what most people fear, like time alone, or change.</p><p>Stop trying to teach people you love to love themselves, it?s a personal journey.</p><p>Everyone thinks they know the best way to raise their kids into happy and self-reliant adults, but it never happens according to plan. Just become the parent you wish you had, and enjoy the process.</p><p>Interesting read, both the article and the thread, thanks for sharing! Like for most ?issues?, the answer is: ?it depends?, indeed!??</p><p>Just a random guy trying to make any positive difference at my scale. ?? Have a great life! ??</p><p>Dear everyone, I believe in you. ??</p><p>By definition,  the most interesting people lead a unique life: dont blindly seek their book recommendations, dont blindly imitate their lifestyle. You wouldnt find the answer you seek, and you would never build self-esteem.</p><p>Memory improves once you switch from memorizing to understanding.</p><p>One person believing in you can change everything. If you can, be that person for someone else.</p><p>Flaws = opportunity to build self-esteem.</p><p>Speed reading is less about reading faster, and more about ignoring the parts that won?t impact your life: more time to focus on the ?right? ideas, relevant to your circumstances.</p><p>Meaningful education starts with self-education.</p><p>Read until you can read the brightest: they will lead you to your brightest.</p><p><span><a href="https://t.co/9pXqtbTI32">https://t.co/9pXqtbTI32</a></span></p><p>Yeah exactly, in the end, you need practice. But it helps to have an idea of what kind of writer you could become.</p><p>Just do it sir. ??</p><p>I would say so, yes. Reading provides the foundations to be more eloquent (orally) as well,  although you need conversational practice with a wide range of clear-minded people to grow self-confident.</p><p>If you are scared of writing because you dislike the way you phrase your thoughts, it?s not a lack of talent, you just need to spend an additional few thousands of hours on quality books.</p><p>A constantly judging mind projects itself and believes everyone is the same, but happy people, with a sense of purpose, a family they love, passions to pursue, have a lot fewer negative thoughts than the average folk.</p><p>Start writing about your parents to notice how much you don?t know about them.</p><p>Time wasted is less wasted if it leads to valuing your time more.</p><p>Be a good person instead of wasting time thinking you?re a good person.</p><p>Singers are applied physicists experimenting with air. Body builders are applied physicists experimenting with gravity. Lovers are applied physicists experimenting with life.</p><p>Learning is about experimenting with your own life, connecting the pieces together, and forming a mental theory. School is about experience-less minds, with no foundations, memorizing the mental theory of mankind?s brightest minds, explained by average minds. It doesn?t work.</p><p>Money won?t buy you self-love, make you less angry, or less cynical, or less pessimistic. These are habits. But it will get you time. To sleep. To do what you love. To educate yourself. To do nothing. To eat healthier food. To work out. To spend with people you love.</p><p>When you are kind to others, you are doing yourself a favor first.</p><p>Blaming parents is lack of empathy. You would think much more highly of them if you had exact knowledge of the lives they led until their current age. Outrage is the more contagious force, but we need way more kindness.</p><p>When anger is your default state,  you no longer notice your agressivity, and the happy people you could be friends with will silently evade you.</p><p>Most ?problems? would go unnoticed if someone didn?t point them out.</p><p>It?s not about salary, it?s about not having to work.</p><p>Those who claim money doesn?t buy happiness either don?t have any, or haven?t figured out how to use it properly.</p><p>Learn from the unhappy by studying and avoiding what they do; learn from the happy by studying and imitating what they don?t do.</p><p>The only valuable relationships, are those that wouldn?t break if people could read each other?s thoughts.</p><p>Intelligent  attractive people care less about attractiveness, and more about intelligence, than the average folk. They understand their own desires. They understand that beauty fades away, but beautiful minds keep growing. They are rarely found in their twenties.</p><p>If you truly don?t care, the thought ?I don?t care? doesn?t even cross your mind.</p><p>If you were born in a ?poor? family with access to fewer opportunities, consider it a game set on a higher difficulty mode: you will get more satisfaction as you reach the different milestones of growth.</p><p>If life doesn?t improve in the long run,  it?s because your good and bad habits cancel each other out. Mindfulness is the habit of noticing where your efforts are leaking out.</p><p>One of the most exquisite feelings in life is when separate pieces of understanding connect in your mind. You can?t predict how and when it happens, but they are ?zero to one? moments of clarity to live for.</p><p>Never be scared of being mocked. Intelligent people never make fun of anyone trying hard. Those who do make you a favor by exposing their true colors.</p><p>Being disliked isn?t scary, spending a lifetime disliking yourself is.</p><p>If you are reading this, everything you need for a life far less scary than all your ancestors awaits you. On the device you hold. Connected to the biggest encyclopedia ever made. You just need to understand that growing your mind is the most meaningful form of entertainment.</p><p>Learning is most enjoyable with the self-confidence that you can learn anything. And self-confidence is acquired: No baby is born full of, or lacking in, self-confidence.</p><p>No amount of external validation will ever compare to the happiness stemming from a clear mind in a fit body.</p><p>The more you take peoples attention for granted, the less attention you get from the right people, those who value respect and integrity.</p><p>The less you have,  the more you are scared to give.</p><p>Values predict long-term behavior. Desires predict short-term behavior. When it comes to relationships where happiness keeps compounding, seek mutual high values  low desires.</p><p>People want to be seen doing something even though it means effectively doing nothing, and they are scared of being seen doing nothing, though that often leads to actually doing something.</p><p>If everyone reads the same books, no one thinks independently, so I?d recommend people to follow their own curiosity. Self-love stems from you knowing you are unique, and the seeking path is part of it. There?s no recipe, it?s difficult;  that?s why it will be worth it.</p><p>If you no longer know who to trust, don?t understand why you think  react the way you do, but want to love yourself more, throw away every single belief you have. A radical but efficient method: spend a year as alone as possible with books that survived the passage of time.</p><p>If you could navigate and ?see? everybody?s causes of anxiety, you would first laugh at some of them, then you would laugh at yours.</p><p>We envy what we think was within our reach.</p><p>The recipe for genius is constant focused learning in the direction of curiosity.</p><p>Not being angry is the new contrarian.</p><p>Our ancestors were lost in dogma for millenia because they were misled. We are no smarter today. Only better equipped. In both truths and lies. The Internet will create a bubble of misled people dispossessed of the humility required for the art of learning.</p><p>We all think we are unique, yet we all live the same way.  Thoughts and intentions are irrelevant when the actions are mostly conform. Unique actions lead to unique perspectives.</p><p>Originality starts when you stop thinking you are unique.</p><p>The faster you realize you don?t need an identity, the sooner you will start growing, which will naturally lead to happiness.</p><p>You are rich when you can afford to not do what you don?t want to do, but first, you need to understand your wants.</p><p>Anxiety is the difference between what you are doing and what you could do.</p><p>People who don?t respect you when you are poor and achievement-less, still don?t respect you after you turn your life around; but now, you aren?t so sure anymore. If you want valuable relationships, you don?t want to impress with anything but your mind.</p><p>If the whole world thinks you are a fool, you have unlimited upside learning potential with zero downside fear.</p><p>Once you have solid mental foundations  figured out the right life direction, success is about patiently maintaining the flow whilst avoiding decisional suicides.</p><p>Self-confidence is the convergence point between what you think you are, what you want to be, and what you are.</p><p>Learn to enjoy not thinking.</p><p>People start caring when you no longer care about them caring.</p><p>Not admitting a mistake because you are scared of losing respect is a sure way to lose it.</p><p>Anger, irritation, constant judgment, anxiety, are part of the unintelligent behavior of the mind, which I define as what makes you miserable, and yet, you can?t just act upon it.</p><p>Mindfulness is about noticing your own unintelligent behavior,  realizing nothing needs to define you, and suddenly you get more intelligent.</p><p>Most want to feel smart, not be smart.</p><p>Repeating wisdom you?ve heard doesn?t mean you understand. Reaching the same conclusions through an entirely different journey does.</p><p>Rejoice from failure: the bubble of ego popped, healthy growth can now start.</p><p>Upon being ?wronged?, some repeat the behavior onto others, while some others try to improve things. The difference is called intelligence.</p><p>Independent thinking not misled by the veil of ego always leads to similar conclusions when it comes to fame. Their assessment of higher order effects leads to the avoidance of such paths, unless some greater purposes require the sacrifice of their own happiness.</p><p>Rejoice from being ?done with school?: you can now start learning.</p><p>I doubt keeping yourself hungry is ever a wise long-term solution unless it?s part of writing a book on poverty and its inhibiting of cognitive skills. Rather, avoiding having millions of dollars at your instant disposal can be ?good?, but again, it depends on your goal.</p><p>The real invisible tax isn?t inflation: it?s lack of self-love, sucking away opportunities you were born with.</p><p>Finding the market for a product you truly think is valuable; and although depending on the field, there are occasionally grey areas, there are also many where authenticity takes us way further than games of deception when it comes to long-term self-esteem.</p><p>Not trying to look cool is cool. Not trying to look smart is smart. Pretend to be what you are not, and you will never be what you could be.</p><p>Smart people spend years wondering why it doesn?t make sense, questioning what they may have missed, when society simply went crazy. A lifetime running to get wants rather than needs, social approval, imaginary money, disease-creating food. We need more independent thinkers.</p><p>If you want to reach people,  start valuing their attention.</p><p>Genius is about connecting old things in new ways, not memorizing new things in old ways.</p><p>Judging mind, unhappy mind.</p><p>You wont get insights or creativity if you are too financially comfortable, but it wont happen either if you are barely scraping by, unable to afford time to actually pause and think. Depending on what you want to achieve, the zone is yours to figure out.</p><p>If you feel embarassed by something, go tell people about it. You will understand the irrationality of your mind, constantly finding imaginary reasons to be unhappy.</p><p>Quickest way to solve is to remove the source of expectations. Hang out with driven  self-loving people.  They have no time to pay attention to you.</p><p>Anxiety is when external expectation meets lack of results.</p><p>If you ever tell lies in a relationship, ask yourself whether it?s dissimilar values or personal insecurities.</p><p>Read until reading no longer requires focus; then start reading books that require focus again.</p><p>It?s much easier to think rationally with a financial safety net. Going from zero to one is hard: little self-confidence, many fears. But you aren?t alone. Everyone goes through similar doubts. Exercise mindfulness. Remove noise irrelevant to your life. It gets better.</p><p>You won?t help the sick by getting sick. Anger and anxiety are contagious. Inspire change, but keep some distance.</p><p>Many envy those born in rich families, without realizing the journey from poverty to wealth is where lies the value: you will build the self-esteem required for long-lasting happiness.</p><p>Thank you for the kind message! ????</p><p>Pretty much everything comes from my personal experience; the difficult part is ?just? about connecting things, aka learning.

Your physical/mental limits are personal. Few people have the patience to stick to disciplined efforts for a decade. Those who did, will tell you you are way more than any of your beliefs.</p><p>Lower emotional responsiveness, clearer, firmer, happier mind.</p><p>Self-introspection is the beginning of self-understanding, indeed. ?someone else?.</p><p>The more someone keeps bringing what someone else said in the past, the more likely they are stagnating, and projecting onto others. Fast growing individuals barely remember their thinking process from a few years ago.</p><p>Yep agreed!  I mainly had in mind the mechanical aspects of teaching (typically, primary school) ? imo the teachers constantly seeking growth may quickly lose interest after a few years, and as a 6-11 y.o kid, you might be less likely to meet ?life-changing? teachers.</p><p>The problem with the best teachers is that they are often too busy learning.</p><p>Learning is more fun when all your mental models are built from first principles.</p><p>Exactly. ??</p><p>There is only a small difference between living a life and living a lie.</p><p>Conversations get more interesting once you care more about learning than talking.</p><p>There?s no shortage of opportunities, only of self-esteem.</p><p>?I never doubted?,  said no honest successful person ever.</p><p><span>I had these people in mind.

Making a positive change is already complex, but the very people you are trying to make the change for usually don?t care. Bitcoin, privacy, freedom of speech. Easier to just give up if you already have it all.</p><p>One good reason to keep learning and grow a clearer mind: because it takes intelligence to assess intelligence, you will no longer waste time with charlatans. No more being fooled by status and credentials.</p><p>Grow into someone you would like to hang out with, and suddenly you understand the value of friendships.</p><p>You can feel something without reacting  being pulled towards its gravity.  Or at least, not to the extent where you become unaware of your actions. Sociopaths probably have a different definition of happiness, not sure. I?m not involved with anyone I can?t seem to grasp.</p><p>The interpretation of any word will always be subject to the reader?s mind, indeed.</p><p>Happiness is inversely correlated with the amount of time spent on emotionally connotated thoughts.</p><p>You should always be wondering why it wasn?t so obvious for your past self.</p><p>Time spent with people you can no longer trust is wasted.</p><p>Clever converts wants into reality. Genius redefines wants at will.</p><p>Great question. Learning is a different process for everybody, so I doubt there will ever be a consensus, a ?perfect? system. But better would be leveraging the digital tools to give access to ?the best? lecturers (not just the local average one). But we quickly get political.</p><p>Depends on their own preferences, but there are plenty of ways to challenge them: maths, music, martial arts...

Clarity is the space in-between.</p><p>You won?t find self-esteem in books. You won?t get rid of loneliness with entertainment and parties. You won?t be happy by giving in to short-term desires. Fear only grows stronger when you hide from the truth. You won?t find clarity through discussions with others.</p><p>Wouldn?t wish it to anybody else,  but a near-death experience is the best way to start living everyday with gratitude.

Give them a chance to engage a multitude of disciplines  let them choose. Chess. Dancing. Singing. Acting. Karate. Novels. Science. Whatever. Plenty of opportunities to travel  meet interesting folks.</p><p>School provides smart kids a sense of satisfaction where there should be none. Flattery. Good grades. Good rankings.

More seriously, a great way to learn is to read something ?slightly? difficult: it?s challenging, but fun, and you are less likely to give up. It completely depends on who you are now. Many books that I found hard to comprehend in the past feels dull today.</p><p>Idealization ends mimetic growth. When lost, find a model. Someone happy, smart, kind, honest, with a lovely family, rich, fit, funny... Anything you want to pretend to. But don?t fool yourself into thinking they?re flawless. Love yourself more than any idea of any guru.</p><p>You don?t ?control?, ?master? or ?force? your mind to do anything. Don?t treat your kids like that either. Instead, take the time to listen. Treat it with kindness and love. Deep mutual understandings make the best relationships.</p><p>It?s not dirty, it just goes against your idea of cleanness.

It?s achieved by strong self-esteem, which tosses aside the desire to impress.</p><p>Learning starts when people understand where the belief they cannot understand came from. And get rid of it.</p><p>People who are smart, rich  happy are amongst the most humble  discreet.</p><p>You are free to disagree with anything, but the goal should always be learning, and to grow, and to live a happier life, and respect will get you much further.</p><p>It mainly requires the courage to be seen by others as doing ?nothing? for a little while.</p><p>That?s a solution, but it takes much more time and it?s pretty wasteful in terms of efforts. The only constraint is often financial ? we can?t stop running, and we are too exhausted during weekends to even think about what we should or shouldn?t do to grow into a better self.</p><p>Also the reason why teaching to think is so hard: scarcity of teachers. Most don?t have the necessary contrast (through personal change) and empathy to imagine how students struggle when the foundations are nonexistent.</p><p>You need to empty the cup of dirty water before you can fill it with clean one. But mind leads us astray.  ?There will be no more water?, it says. Hence why old habits and emotional responses rarely die. Mere fear.</p><p>We love kids because they?re imperfect.

But if you drown yourself in fake smiles and empty entertainment, the happiness compass is miscalibrated. A mother taking care of her innocent baby: that?s the happy face you seek.</p><p>Anxiety is sometimes the remnant of a smothered desire for self-expression.</p><p>They are not angry with you: they use you as an excuse to get angry in order to forget their unhappiness.</p><p>If you are reading this, you already have everything you need.</p><p>Becoming rich is just about serving others in a scalable way.</p><p>It?s suddenly less exhausting when you spend time with happy people (as opposed to most at work, or in bars) and people that you love because your relationship with them feels natural and effortless. And that?s usually also how every long-term  valuable relationship feels like.</p><p>Self-esteem is the difference between what you create and what you consume.</p><p>You no longer need credentials once you have results; but until then, society is still fueled by social signaling and mimetic desires, and it helps when people think you are smart before they understand you are smart. It?s one more chance to tell your story.</p><p>Agreed! It?s the chicken  problem compounding on the first few years, setting some self-limiting beliefs for the next few decades, and it?s difficult to change, but nothing impossible compared to the world we live in.</p><p>There?s no such thing as ?being introvert? or ?being extrovert?. It?s all habits. Spend a few years on a desert island without socializing with anybody. Or in a big city, going out and talking to strangers everyday. You will understand you are only defined by your actions.</p><p>The real reason is that we feel uncomfortable around people much smarter than us; hence why courage is a prerequisite to learning.</p><p>When you have access to the perspective and wisdom of the brightest minds of mankind, but you still decide to learn from the local average minds because ?you can always learn something from someone?, that?s a choice. The world won?t adjust its growth speed to yours though.</p><p>Don?t ask for feedback if you just want approval.</p><p>I think people should be kind to themselves though. Growing implies making many  mistakes. It?s difficult to get out of a vicious circle of bad habits compounding into bad decisions. But the ?right? people tend to be the most open to others? change: they don?t live in the past.</p><p>It?s easy to get angry with the angry, or violent with the violent, or scapegoat the scapegoater, or gossip about the gossiper. Don?t become what you despise: earn the privilege of ignoring noise.</p><p>If you don?t trust yourself, it only makes sense if people don?t trust you either.</p><p>If you think of yourself as average, its probably because youve spent a lifetime with average teachers. The Internet gives access to more equality of opportunity, but opening the door requires courage and mental strength.</p><p>Few people build successful businesses, but equally few people understand their own desires, let alone others?.</p><p>No one who achieved anything valuable has ever been fully certain,  but they didn?t use doubting as an excuse for inaction.</p><p>Meditation is the art of doing nothing in order to achieve something.</p><p>A valuable person possesses rare traits. Anger, cynicism  pessimism aren?t rare.</p><p>Sincerity is irrelevant in a society where many believe their own lies.</p><p>There is no ?good? and ?bad? weather; there?s the weather,  and there?s a constantly judging mind.</p><p>People who had ?bad? experiences abroad rarely tried to adapt. They expected people to behave the same way as in their home country. You grow resentful when you refuse to grow.</p><p>The fastest way to notice all your biases is to move out of your country. Pick up a place you neither understand the language nor the culture, keep an open mind, observe, listen, and enjoy your second experience of learning from scratch like a kid.</p><p>Don?t ask a question you haven?t tried to answer first.</p><p>Safety has never been the default state in human lives. We are not meant to be in control. We should constantly grow and adapt. Stagnation is a modern disease caused by a harmful illusion of stability.</p><p>If you wake up naturally without feeling tired, you?ve had enough sleep.  To me, it?s around 8 hours.

Just read and think a lot more. Speed is a natural consequence.</p><p>Maybe you don?t want to grow up, but grow down towards the default state of happiness you had as a baby.</p><p>Don?t fall in love with the idea of doing something. Do it and fall in love with the process.</p><p>Keep track of why you do difficult things. It?s not about being praised. It?s not about any reward. It?s about growing. Constant growth is the key to happiness.

Athletes, who consistently overcome theirs, understand that quite well. The intellectuals who consistently deliver deep work understand that too. The mind is great at misleading us.</p><p>Don?t get outraged if people ignore you. You are free to talk,  people are free to not listen. It?s absurd to assume anyone owes you their attention.</p><p>If you have no idea what you will be doing a year from now, you are accelerating your learning curve.

No music  no podcast whilst commuting. Everyone may be running, it doesn?t mean it?s the wisest course of action.</p><p>You can have a perfectly civilized conversation with someone you disagree with. Great insights arise from exchanges between mindful people who leave aside ego  pride, who notice  let their irritations fade away, who solely focus on growing their pool of ideas  perspectives.</p><p>The fewer achievements one has,  the faster one dismisses others? efforts. We all heard immature kids say  ?I could do it too if I wanted?. A grown-up understands the gap between imagination  reality. Learning is hard.

Sometimes, life happens. Momentarily weak. One bad judgment.  And the following consequences.</p><p>Another reason why financially independent people are happier.

All you need to do is throw away your beliefs, and start asking why like a kid would do: learning is just about fulfilling your curiosity.</p><p>Some people seem to think that there are some geniuses out there, who could reach a native level of any foreign language in a month, or who could cure cancer, diabetes  Alzheimer in a week.

Don?t forget... ?? ? to sleep ?? ? to be kind ?? ? to take breaks ?? Life isn?t just about productivity  maximization.</p><p>It all comes down to proper self-assessment in the end. I?ve witnessed many cases of people overrating themselves. ?Thinking about finding what I want to do? for years now. Blaming the system  externalities, never their lack of efforts. Intelligence = not fooling yourself</p><p>Courage is all you need for personal growth. The courage to overcome insecurities. The courage to surround yourself with people that make you feel irrelevant. The courage to swallow ego. The courage to spend more time on actual efforts than on the safety net.</p><p>Many point out how school has failed. It hasn?t. You were wrong to think its purpose was to nurture curiosity. You were wrong to think it was about raising generations of independent thinkers. School was about fulfilling society?s needs not maximizing individuals? potential.</p><p>Life is a perpetual journey from one wrong belief to another less wrong belief.</p><p>Mindful efforts compounded on years. If you look back on yourself from three years ago  barely recognize who you were, you grew. If not, imagine who you could become in three years. And how. It will give you a clearer goal; but without mindfulness, people easily ?forget? it.</p><p>Money solves most problems, because it buys you time. Time to educate yourself on how you?re harming your own body  mind ?? And to stop it  start growing instead ?? Time to release stress  accumulated negative emotions ????? Time to not constantly worry about productivity ?</p><p>And yet, many are ostentatiously blaming a country like Japan for its carefulness when it comes to immigration. There?s always a trade-off.</p><p>You don?t deserve unconditional respect just because you?re a parent. Or unconditional love just because you?re a spouse. Or unconditional attention just because you?re a friend. No one owes you anything. Especially if you stopped making efforts.</p><p>Self-help books are no replacement for thinking by yourself. Its tempting to believe that reading will necessarily improve your life. But growth requires mindful and disciplined implementation. Similarly, meditation is mere social signaling if theres no positive effect.</p><p>Writing is just another form of meditation  self-reflection.</p><p>Pretty much all the people around me who immediately claim how everything is easy  simple, tend to be struggling in their lives. Even when everything is flowing seamlessly, you can be struck by misfortune anytime,  and be stuck in a vicious circle for years.</p><p>The common denominators for all the relationships that just work?

You wake up. What are you looking forward to doing? Giving? Building? Creating? Someone you are excited to meet?  Or take care of? Spouse? Kids? Students? Walking the talk is what purpose is about. Living an authentic human life with no self-deception, no lies.</p><p>Without a clear purpose, emptiness is inevitable. We give it different names. Depression. Chronic anxiety. Blues. Melancholia. But once your body, main driver of your mind, understands where it?s headed, even the most seemingly mundane journey becomes meaningful  enjoyable.</p><p>Will definitely check it out, thank you ! ??</p><p>There was a time when I thought ? Two years spent abroad was a lot ? 24 hours of fasting was a lot ? Reading for 4 hours a day was a lot ? Working out 3 times a week was a lot ? Too much to learn, impossible to grasp ?the big picture? You are always way more than your thoughts.</p><p>You don?t read because you want to impress. You don?t raise kids to show off with neighbors. You don?t work out to exhibit your body. You don?t meditate for social signaling. You don?t spend time with your parents for productivity. You do them because you love the process.</p><p>To the people who significantly improved their life through books: Don?t try to convince anyone verbally unless you view it as an exercise for your speaking skills. Just give them book recommendations. High agency people will read them immediately  apply. The majority won?t.</p><p>The very people who need to understand this rarely have the opportunity to learn it. Because they are stuck in the vicious circle of being defensive  taking everything personally. And happy people who can teach  change lives dont make efforts if you dont fully open up.</p><p>Japan?s society is in many ways, optimized for their people?s well-being  convenience, and being able to eat healthily without necessarily having to spend time on cooking is one good reason amongst many for my choice of staying here. ??</p><p>The reason why you rarely see happy people around you? They tend to be smart  keep a low profile. Happiness is about less, not more. Less anger. Less drama. Less paranoia. It?s about minimizing bullshit.</p><p>Hanging out with non-mindful people means bearing with negative value comments  incessant complaints. A great habit that will reshape your circle of close friends: before speaking ask yourself if you?re gonna be ? insightful ? funny ? kind If not, keep the words to yourself.</p><p>If you grew up in an environment, or around people, who made you feel unworthy, anxious  insecure step 1 ? distance yourself step 2 ? never go back Negative emotions are buried deeper than you think  under successive layers of stored suffering. They can always resurface.</p><p>It?s hard to see someone growing fast: it reminds us of our inertia  lack of agency. That?s why most will pretend to not see how much you?ve changed. 18 months are enough to become someone else entirely.

A clear mind</p><p>Thank you! ??</p><p>If your first reaction is to find counter arguments, you have been raised with a conflictual mindset. As such, you sometimes forget to truly listen. Consistently proving other people wrong won?t make you happier.</p><p>Writing regularly will change your whole perspective ? Whenever you are struck by misfortune, whenever you are challenged by unfavorable randomness, you know that those trials are the mere future foundations of interesting stories.</p><p>Everytime you think you?ve figured things out ? fitness, nutrition, relationships, career, self-control... life will quickly remind you of how conceitedly wrong you were.

They received a solid education compounding their curiosity  imagination for decades. As for the minority of those who ?make it? against all odds, they feel disconnected from where they came from. An opportunity to learn kindness.</p><p>Maybe you enjoy deep conversations about a wide range of topics, and your parents don?t, and seem only interested in the weather or what you had for lunch earlier. But growing cynical is the best way to build future regrets. Listen more, and you?ll discover hidden treasures.</p><p>Its easy to forget that accidental deaths and sudden diseases can strike anytime. As a consequence of their own - often painful - experiences, the most mature people deeply understand the fragility of life, and rarely waste any time on pointless conflicts.</p><p>The happiest families don?t go around claiming they are doing great. The richest people don?t go around claiming they have money. The smartest people don?t go around debating just to show off their intellect.

You can?t understand yourself if you simply avoid conflicts through isolation though you can?t build yourself by constantly running into problems either.</p><p>People feel the need to put labels on themselves to justify their behavior. It leads to a self-reinforcing cycle. A self-fulfilling prophecy. Granted a complete change of environment, anyone can become someone else entirely in less than five years.</p><p>I don?t meditate in a silent room alone. I keep myself in chaotic environments. Observe my judgmental/emotional reactions. Skin in the game in the bull/bear cycles of #Bitcoin. Or walking in a crowded street. Meditation isn?t to be scheduled.  It?s simply constant awareness.</p><p>Building meaningful relationships based on mutual trust takes years. In a society where conscientiousness is not so common and where fewer and fewer people understand the importance of real  genuine social connections you will need efforts to keep valuable  people around you.</p><p>There is no talent for speaking. The best public speakers have simply followed their curiosity on a wide range of topics wrote things down for consolidation have had plenty of opportunities to practice their skills with partners and compounded it all through several decades.</p><p>When I see parents incessantly arguing with each other in front of their kids, I am the witness of a crime: the foundations of anger  misery building up in an innocent victim?s mind, slowly burying the source of many smiles.</p><p>People full of ego spilling anger in the process are contagious. Partially by mimetism, it?s easy to lose sight of ourselves when the environment favors such behaviors. Because we attract who we think we deserve, people who reflect our values, it?s not easy to notice our anger.</p><p>The apparent freedom you get always requires sacrifices elsewhere, because we still live in a society where individual, egotistical ventures are being frowned upon overall. See entrepreneurs when they fail ? ?told you!? schadenfreude is what they tend to get.</p><p>You can learn way more by taking one year off to follow your curiosity, than throughout two decades of passive formal education. The most essential, yet overlooked, topics at school imo: mindfulness - nutrition - sleep - physical  mental habits - money - abstract thinking ...</p><p>Regardless of your confidence for your physical and/or mental health today, keep in mind that it doesn?t take much to disrupt it all.

Nor do you need to constantly think about how to optimize your habits to compound long-term benefits. Many of the happiest people who ever lived had very simple lives.</p><p>Think about the last time you?ve done ?nothing?. Not listening to anything but the blowing wind.

External signaling has an internal cost. You rarely hear about the happiest people.</p><p>I quickly give up on explaining anything through words when it comes to meditation; people who understand the concept of less external noise, more internal substance are few, and they usually have had interesting lives / learning experiences which cannot be substituted.</p><p>Amongst the things that positively surprised me when I started living in Japan: No stigma when it comes to eating alone in a restaurant.

Yet, we easily spend our lives simultaneously avoiding it  asking ourselves why it feels empty.

Your mistake was to expect attention.</p><p>Thanks for the shoutout man! I really appreciate! ?? ??</p><p>Reading  exchanging ideas with curious minds build your character. But once your principles are defined  anchored to the unconscious decision-making process, you will naturally want to make an impact on the world. Unhappy people tend to feel empty because they don?t build.</p><p>Many want to become millionaires because they picture a lavish lifestyle. Being a millionaire doesnt mean youre spending your money. It means you have the money sitting in bank accounts/investments. The real value comes from the time you can now spend on yourself  others.</p><p>Children differentiate themselves into adults once they overcome the fear of the dark and the fear of loneliness. Plenty of scared adult children out there, regardless of their age, clinging to unmendable relationships.</p><p>Value comes from the seemingly boring: Reading the same books twice with different perspectives. A daily workout routine pushing your limits. Focusing on long-term relationships in love, business or family.

Anxiety isnt a state we cant break free from once we get a better grasp of the chaos  uncertainties of life.</p><p>The widening gap between the self-driven eager to learn individuals and the sleepwalking masses already has visible consequences. The former never wastes a single opportunity to grow. The latter lives in anxiety. You only fear challenges when you are not ready to face them.</p><p>You dont find happiness by aiming for happiness. Similarly, you dont innovate by aiming for innovation,  nor do you usually get rich by aiming for money. Byproducts tend to be on misleading directions when it comes to your focus.

Vannevar Bush</p><p>Everything comes down to the method used to scale from simple systems to complex systems. Unstable frameworks are doomed to break.</p><p>The reason why you become more attractive once you?re married/in a relationship?  The same as why it?s easier to get a job when you already have one.

The snowball effect of building a network of honest, high integrity  trustworthy people, often results in unpredictably positive outcomes as long as you choose the right direction.</p><p>Similarly, it?s easier to get a job when you already have one. Or being attractive when you are already in a relationship. Or saying smart stuff when you don?t care about saying smart stuff. The ?unneediness?  boosted self-confidence completely change people?s perception.</p><p>Indifference to money unveils many concealed financial opportunities.</p><p>... is what I would tell myself if I had kids. Just a personal note for myself,  because when life happens, it?s much harder to step back  assess the situation objectively. All advice are welcome. ?? Avoiding the common mistakes is already a half-success imo.</p><p>Kids seem to be less influenced by their parents than by external feedback: teachers, friends, books, media. One responsibility: don?t inhibit their curiosity. Feed them a broad/balanced set of views. Whether the seeds sown evolve into a beautiful mind isn?t yours to control.</p><p>Being wordy is a side effect of a fuzzy mind. The longer the definition, the less accurate the meaning. Think about the most beautiful mathematical equations.</p><p>Probably a very big percentage considering sugar is the most commonly spread drug.</p><p>Similarly to playing chess,  you can win many of the games of life if you minimize your bad moves. It all depends on your opponents and whether it?s a zero-sum game.</p><p>?If a man has lost a leg or an eye, he knows he has lost a leg or an eye;  but if he has lost a self?himself?he cannot know it, because he is no longer there to know it.? ? Oliver Sacks</p><p>Maybe he is not arrogant. Maybe you just lack self-confidence, and as a mirror of your doubts, he highlights your insecurities.</p><p>Lack of mindfulness is comparable to the first time you drive a car: you are overwhelmed by information,   you have no idea what to focus on, you get anxious as you can?t control what you want to control. Meditation leads to the understanding that nothing is under control.</p><p>Relax, the universe doesn?t need to make any sense, for any meaning generated by our mind is a byproduct of itself. The sun burns. The river flows. The mirror reflects. Self-consciousness is wordy  reactive, which torments its vessel and strips away peace.</p><p>I like the last one. Reminds me that everyday, you are one decision away from a completely different life. The compounded consequences of seemingly small decisions are only visible years or decades later though.</p><p>It?s easy to mistake your first shift of perception/understanding of the world for enlightenment.</p><p>The flow of a river doesn?t change when you throw in more water. Similarly, the best insights don?t emerge just because you think harder.</p><p>Broadly speaking, the same reasoning is applicable to music, hobbies, whatever. Many seem oblivious of the fact that two people sharing similar taste has nothing to do with principles, the one thing that matters most. Same interest can even mean less reciprocal value created.</p><p>Thoughts are intangible  ephemerous; they cross our mind in an instant  they?re gone forever, leaving nothing. But they submerge us  their continuity leads us astray. Actions, on the other hand, have visible consequences that are reflected through the mirror of the world.</p><p>The same way there will always be someone richer or more attractive, there will always be someone smarter to prove you wrong whatever you say. That?s an opportunity to learn. Why would you be afraid of being ridiculized anyway since our existence itself could be one big joke.</p><p>But because the fear of potential physical violence is in a corner of our mind, people handle the situation more or less poorly. It?s much easier to keep calm  solve the issue pacifically when you know you could knock down your ?opponent? anytime. Healthy body, healthy mind.</p><p>Considering that you decide whether to attribute any meaning  weight to the words pronounced - which are, essentially, just sound waves that are captured by your ears  interpreted by your brain -, a deep understanding of yourself allows you to handle any verbal conflict imo.</p><p>As for our relationship with ourselves: children are rarely tormented by their own state of being. Originally, it?s all effortless. But this stable  conflictless connection is lost due to conditioning  noise. The original beauty of innocence should be sought in subtraction.</p><p>A personal rule to sort through my relationships  only focus on the few needed: If I think about you  it brings either anxiety or irritation, youre out. Lots of happy people out there. I dont waste time with toxicity. The best relationships are effortless from the start.</p><p>?I wish someone had told me earlier.? Don?t be too hard on yourself. Chances are that you wouldn?t have listened. Independent thinkers, by definition, don?t blindly rely on others? conclusions: Education is a mindful process of assimilation, not a rash and confused one.</p><p>With the exception of a few extraordinarily gifted  prolific writers (B. Russell  al) I?m wary of those who hastily publish a lot of books. Great books aren?t just thoughts thrown on pieces of paper. High standards are the result of long recursively incremental improvements.</p><p>Talking about dreams, I?ve had an increasingly amount of them since: 1) I started a dream journal2) I reduced my stress to almost zero3) I started fasting (?22 hours) everyday More space in my stomach,  more space between my thoughts, more dreams. Or maybe not. Who knows.</p><p>Our mind, our memories, our thoughts. Our imagination, our instincts, our emotions. Our dreams, our words, our beliefs. They are but a small subset of what Nature generously granted us. A drop of clarity in the ocean of the unknowable unconscious.</p><p>Think of our current model of the world. A globe of dirt, revolving around a giant fire ball, part of an expanding universe intermingling space, time, matter.. from which I, a self-aware monkey,  generate sequences of words in order to find peace? Nothing surprises me anymore.</p><p>?We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark;  the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.? ? Plato</p><p>Misled people often use the word ?obvious?. Nothing is obvious. Everything is incrementally discovered through the generations, conceptualized  reassimilated from scratch. Much of it is probably wrong. Our insignificant knowledge is engulfed in the immensity of ignorance.</p><p>The only things that doesn?t make sense: Thinking that the reality should fit our incomplete  erroneous interpretation of the reality. Things are as they are, but we are misled by what makes us human: the desire to understand  makes sense of a world that supersets us.</p><p>Beware of people who never introduce you to their acquaintances. They tend to be either: 1) dishonest ? which leads to inner conflicts  a later surge of harmful air you don?t wish to breathe in 2) plain ignorant ? and don?t realize how much social value they miss out on</p><p>The opportunity cost of attention follows the power of compound interest and it?s expanding at a quicker pace than what our imperfect  subjective mind can assess.</p><p>Living through others leads to disappointment, but don?t mistake it with understanding yourself through others. We live surrounded by mirrors reflecting our flaws and disarrays. The confusion of our pathless journey is only exacerbated by the lack of mindful implementation.</p><p>Financial freedom is not a goal. Financial freedom is a step. The beginning of true self-discovery. Think about all the greatest thinkers mankind has nurtured. With a few exceptions (Ramanujan...), most were wealthy. Money buys time which, if wisely spent, yields excellency.</p><p>Hard to find the right balance between personal experience  wisdom absorption through the greatest minds that preceded us. They complement each other and yet, a few tweaks in your priorities can lead to totally different lives. In the end, luck is the predominant power. ?</p><p>?Compulsory education?. ?Compulsory reading?. When you are forcefully required to do something, you simultaneously lose the most valuable aspects. It?s no longer fun, challenging and educating. People should be driven by their interests  principles, not by fear.</p><p>And when you?re in-between: welcome to the comfort zone, where you (wrongly) think you have too much to lose, even though you?re perfectly well-placed to take on life-changing challenges, without realizing that life itself is slipping away in a one-way direction.</p><p>The richer you already are, the easier benefiting from asymmetrical bets become: you have little to lose proportionally to your wealth, and lifetimes of wealth are potentially awaiting you. When you?re poor, just taking the risk seems like an insurmountable task.</p><p>You don?t approach ?the truth?. You simply get away from the deep bottom of ignorance. The further you are, the weaker its attraction, and the less likely you nosedive again.</p><p>Once a star has burnt all of its hydrogen, it collapses under its own weight, creating a black hole. Once an angry man has burnt all his negative energy, he collapses under the weight of his regrets, creating a deadly cloud around him. Avoid both.</p><p><span>In the same line of thought: ?I?m not responsible for what other people think I am able to do; I don?t have to be good because they think I?m going to be good. (...)

Long-term, they are one of the best investments you can make.</p><p>?In her role as a mother,  a neurotic wife who is unsatisfied by her husband becomes over-affectionate and over-anxious towards her child, transfers to it her own need for love and thereby awakens it to sexual precocity.? ? Sigmund Freud</p><p>Anyone else keeping a diary of their dreams? However banal they appear to be,  I feel like the more consistently I take notes right upon waking up (memories of them only last a few seconds before fading away  disappearing forever), and the more dreams I make.</p><p>People who want to take it the wrong way will take it the wrong way. If honesty is a key value for you, you will simply reject any relationship based on deceit. Honest people tend to question themselves rather than blame others anyway. Honesty leads to LT win-win situations.</p><p>A formidable caf‚ which polishes a characteristic we tend to be lacking: the ability to listen. Once you?ve worked your way around the noise  filtered the valuable sources of ideas, after silently learning from the sidelines, you grow into an individual capable to contribute.</p><p>A common misconception: ?You can?t enjoy a game if you?re too serious about it.? Ofc you can. The best athletes, businessmen, parents  scientists are ALWAYS serious. But their mind isn?t clouded. It?s about being serious without losing the playful beginner?s mind.</p><p>Children and adults are likewise all playing games, with one major difference: the latter forgot how to enjoy them. Rekindling the flame of early enthusiasm won?t be achieved through the introduction of new rules. You need less in order to enjoy more.</p><p>New resolution for 2019?

You don?t reap the benefits of compound interest if the spectrum of your attention is overly spread. As with money management  capital preservation, focus on diversification AFTER you grew rich.</p><p>Expect the worse from people and you will get the worse from people. Expect the best from people and you will be disappointed. The solution: expect nothing. No drama, no disenchantment.

Underestimating our abilities to focus  to learn is a common behavior. Hence why people who experienced success once repeatedly supersede their self-imposed restrictions.</p><p>We crave freedom, yet we run away when it?s within our reach.

Also more commonly called peace.</p><p>Surrounding yourself with people who are overall ?better? - more talented, more attractive, more successful, smarter  kinder- isn?t comfortable. But that?s the fastest way to achieve personal growth. One day, you realize the people you were looking up to, now look up to you.</p><p>?Time heals griefs and quarrels, for we change and are no longer the same persons.  Neither the offender nor the offended are any more themselves.? ? Blaise Pascal</p><p>?Every social order incorporates among its key taboos the notion that people living in it should not think about how it will end and what rules may prevail in the new system that takes its place.?  ? James Dale Davidson</p><p>If you need to follow a specific ritual to observe yourself, you?re missing the point of meditation. Programming yourself to blindly follow a recipe is another form of brainwashing. As long as an illusive barrier prevents your mind from seeing, there will be no understanding.</p><p>No one would be bragging about their ?achievements? if they could see how much entirely stems from luck. The network of causality is too complex for the human mind to grasp on its whole, hence we end up taking easy (and wrong, ego-based) shortcuts.</p><p>We are a bunch of monkeys divided into two sexual groups wooing each other communicating with noise made through holes called mouths built on hardware called body running on software called mind with features ranging from thoughts to emotions trying to make sense of it all.</p><p>People who spend their time going out to meet friends tend to be the loneliest. The number of relationships is inversely correlated to their depth. All you need is a few deep relationships based on honesty  trust. And there is no shortcut: it takes time to develop them.</p><p>A schedule isn?t a succession of tasks you unwillingly have to do. Get rid of binary thinking. What you want to do isn?t incompatible with what you need to do. Nor is it incompatible with what your family, or even society, needs.</p><p>?Good? people don?t think they are good people: they don?t spend their time questioning what is right or wrong, because they are busy actually making a difference in this world, and not only through words. Judgmental thoughts barely even cross their minds.</p><p>?By knowing what exist, you can know that which does not exist.  That is the void. People in this world look at things mistakenly, and think that what they do not understand must be the void. This is not the true void. It is confusion.? ? Miyamoto Musashi</p><p>As long as you don?t apply, you still live in the illusion of knowing, fueled by ego  the fear of taking responsibility.</p><p>?Language, that most human invention, can enable what, in principle, should not be possible.  It can allow all of us, even the congenitally blind, to see with another person?s eyes.? ? Oliver Sacks</p><p>Long-term positive consequences tend to be unintended side effects of genuine purposeless actions. Numerous are instances of unconditional love leading to unexpected rewards decades later, or manipulative behaviors leading to perverse  counterproductive effects.</p><p>Courage, honesty  conscientiousness. Whoever possesses those traits will walk on an ascending path. A fulfilling journey towards a better version of themselves. They won?t settle for mediocrity, yet won?t forget to be grateful either. Continuously taking mitigated risks.</p><p>In school, you have a fixed number of questions with their corresponding static answers. In life, the number of questions  answers are infinite  subjectively dynamic, and they take the clouded shape of our desires  fears. That?s why we often end up running directionlessly.</p><p>People who seemingly always make the right decision at the right time, and who find the right words when the needs to mitigate conflicts arise, have simply already accumulated a lifetime of embarrassing mistakes.</p><p>Had a similar experience recently:  people who spend their time gossipping  having negative thoughts also assume that everyone else does the same.</p><p>?We are more often frightened than hurt, and we suffer more from imagination than from reality.? ? Lucius Annaeus Seneca</p><p><span>People who ?aren?t about anything? share common points: ? they are low in energy (but won?t question their nutrition or working out habits, aka lack of conscientiousness) ? they keep making excuses (lack of a sense of responsibility) ? strong ego (? I don?t need to change?) <a href="https://t.co/s1IxT1zdpF">https://t.co/s1IxT1zdpF</a></span></p><p>?Follow your bliss and the universe will open doors where there were only walls.? ? Joseph Campbell</p><p>Many parents spend their time showing their kids how to: ? be angry (arguments) ? be dishonest (not talking when needs arise) ? be anxious (worrying when unnecessary) ? waste time with bad consumption habits While simultaneously expecting to raise models of virtues.</p><p>?Do not pursue what is illusory - property and position:  all that is gained at the expense of your nerves decade after decade and can be confiscated in one fell night.? ? Alexander Solzhenitsyn</p><p>It?s less about what you read  more about how you read. A bad yet commonly advocated vanity metrics is the number of books read: Anything worth building takes time. The faster you accumulate layers of wisdom  knowledge, the more likely you?ll lose sight of the big picture.</p><p>The least interesting people are those who never failed. They never left their comfort zone. They spent a lifetime being afraid of the image they were projecting. They never discovered their own principles, never reached their potential. And they are full of hidden regrets.</p><p>Genuine peace comes from breaking free from ignorance. There is no freedom in ignorance and there is no peace in inner slavery.</p><p>Be particularly careful if you?re grateful and/or you love the above mentioned individuals: It will cloud your judgment, and you will try to justify their situation with excuses, something you might not even do with yourself.</p><p>Help yourself first, help others later, and only if they wish to be helped.</p><p>A lesson I?ve learnt recently: It?s not your responsibility to fix other people?s bad habits. Don?t even mention the topic to those who don?t possess a growth-oriented mindset. Only advise those who seek advice: the others will blame their failure  lack of progress on you.</p><p>Older people who demand respect because they are older tend to be the least respectable: because they stopped growing several decades ago, because their inherent sense of purpose reminds them of their stagnation, they end up living in fear, relying on uncontrollable factors.</p><p>How to make people dislike you: - Tell them truths they refuse to face - Give them practical  applicable advice In both cases, ego  fear will lead them to look for a scapegoat and blame you.</p><p>?Who am I?  Not the body, because it is decaying;  not the mind, because the brain will decay with the body; not the personality, nor the emotions, for these also will vanish with death.? ? Ramana Maharshi</p><p>A big source of anxiety is our tendency to constantly compare ourselves with each other. We do it because we don?t notice how subconscious habits stem from more apparent habits: gossips, voyeurism, self-brainwashing through the media, ... Only compare your present to your past.</p><p>If you feel bad for missing an opportunity, remember:  having opportunities in itself is already worth your gratitude. Being able to take some distance  to adopt new perspectives is mandatory for inner peace, and like most skills, it?s cultivated through diligent practice.</p><p>Long-term relationships which don?t crumble under the pressure of time, tend to unite individuals who possess  value the following traits: ? honesty ? kindness ? imagination ? self-confidence ? sensitivity ? respect ? positivity People inevitably change.  Values stay.</p><p>Scientists are simply men who understand how their mind works, who generalize  apply this comprehension to the whole universe, and who become their own gods through the distillation of their essence.</p><p>Attention is one of the most mismanaged scarce resources. We tend to unawarely let it run away through our constant impulsive reactions, instead of treasuring it as an asset that can lead to exponential growth.</p><p>Gratitude is correlated with self-improvement. Imagine you receive a set of colors from your ancestors. Some only get black  white. Others get the whole visible spectrum. Regardless of your legacy, whether you paint a beautiful life or not just depends on how grateful you are.</p><p><span><a href="https://t.co/tDzw7TUjXN">https://t.co/tDzw7TUjXN</a></span></p><p>Most people spend their lives afraid of being disliked, hence decide to put up a facade. Which becomes the very reason they become disliked: lack of authenticity. If no one ever got angry with you, no one ever loved you either: the opposite of love is indifference.</p><p>If you actively maintain good habits, chances are that you: ? are rarely anxious ? deeply understand your physical  mental abilities ? are an overall genuinely happy person Overthinking  lack of self-confidence became foreign concepts: be kind to those who still struggle.</p><p>Small lies compound into big self-disappointment. Honesty with oneself is a key value.</p><p>It doesn?t matter how kind, thoughtful, honest, positive, mindful or clever you are: there will be days when you?re not being your usual self, when all the amount of good you?ve done will be overshadowed overnight by one mistake. The perfect opportunity to spot true friends.</p><p>Our natural tendency to mimic even aggressive  manipulative behaviors to deal with them short term  also unawarely leads to long term lack of both self-respect and inner peace.</p><p>The sight of peace to the guilty is like an illusionary oasis in the desert to the thirsty man. Seemingly right in front of you, yet inaccessible. The guilty has a nasty specialty: subconscious self-deception.</p><p>?The day you teach the child the name of the bird, the child will never see that bird again.? ? Krishnamurti</p><p>You are not your thoughts.</p><p>?If youre lonely when youre alone, youre in bad company.? ? Jean-Paul Sartre</p><p>Be forgiving. People who can?t forgive others tend to be unable to forgive themselves. They live in the past and are unable to grow as individuals. They are stuck in a subjective image of the reality based on false ideals, which will ineluctably lead them to bitterness.</p><p>In a constantly accelerating society, patience is an undervalued skill. Look back on all your impulsive decisions  see how the outcome could have been different with more time allocated to waiting efficiently. The best results yield from years or even decades of patience.</p><p><span>Unfortunately, most people overlook the notion of opportunity cost  tend to think that ?you can always learn something from someone?: <a href="https://t.co/F9dUx3q4QX">https://t.co/F9dUx3q4QX</a></span></p><p>Seemingly inconsequential lies quickly compound into a complex cycle of self-disappointment and break down all the foundations of self-respect.</p><p>Similarly to having some truth mixed with lies people who ambiguously exhibit good traits are unexpectedly hard to deal with. Sustainable relationships are those where both sides never compromise on honesty. Think of the opportunity cost of dealing with constant manipulation.</p><p>And trust can only be acquired through honesty, starting with oneself.</p><p>The only reason you are here today is because your parents  all the ancestors that preceded them mostly loved each other. You don?t need to show them gratitude. But your spiritual health is inextricably connected to the best way to be grateful:  living a fulfilling life.</p><p>Get rid of noise and unnecessary complexity. The most elegant solutions are found in silence and simplicity.</p><p>Everything you need to know  apply in order to walk a meaningful journey and avoid disastrous outcomes has already been written down. You just need the humility  honesty to admit that you?re still ignorant, and start your real education on the path of independent thinking.</p><p>Peace of mind is a gift of integrity.</p><p>Keep in mind how the biggest creation of value correlated with providing a great service to many. Helping yourself and helping others are far from being incompatible, and that?s one of the best ways to create meaning for yourself. An essential pillar of a healthy life.</p><p>People can spend a lifetime living in false hopes  sour expectations. You don?t owe anyone anything. People don?t owe you anything. If you hear: ?He should do something because he is &amp;lt;insert a label&amp;gt;? Congrats: you can distance yourself from one spiritually blind person.</p><p>It?s not your husband/wife/children. Not your money. You are neither a job nor a belief: The more you assimilate yourself to a possession, the more likely you are to be disappointed when you inevitably need to part ways. Life itself is temporarily borrowed.</p><p>If you doubt someone?s honesty, the solution is simple:  he/she IS NOT honest, or you aren?t either at your core. Beauty recognizes beauty. Strength recognizes strength. Kindness recognizes kindness. And... authenticity recognizes authenticity.</p><p>Things to ask yourself upon reading: ? Opportunity cost? Procrastination or direction-driven research? ? Knowledge acquired? ? Shift of perspective? ? Too simple? -&amp;gt; increase difficulty ? Too difficult? -&amp;gt; clarify your mind with healthier habits ? Which ideas to apply now?</p><p>It?s not about what you can add in your life, it?s about what you can remove. Avoid people who are: ? full of ego ? dishonest/wearing a mask ? constantly sarcastic ? constantly gossipping/distorting the truth ? manipulative ? gloomy ? lacking in kindness ? unhappy ??</p><p>You are the scientist of your own life experiment. And not all scientists have an equally good judgment. Making mistakes  failing quickly is part of the process; just make sure you?re not heading to a dead-end.</p><p>2 unhappy people together = 1 unhappy couple It?s insane to believe that getting into  a relationship solves individual issues. If you truly radiate happiness, a direct consequence of a healthy lifestyle, you naturally attract other similar souls: work on yourself first.</p><p>Taking financial decisions based on what you can afford to lose is the worst course of action. You didn?t get rich by thinking: ?I can afford to gamble those $2k.? You got rich by thinking: ?How should I optimize those $2k in order to seize opportunities  minimize risks??</p><p>Imagine having instant access to countless lifetimes of stories  knowledge left by our ancestors, yet still repeating the same mistakes they did two thousand years ago.</p><p>Being surrounded by kind people while growing up can constitute a handicap once you?re an adult: you won?t be able to recognize  avoid evil people. And similarly to how you only need to succeed once to be financially free, a single mistake can also ruin your while life.</p><p>Clarity of mind naturally appears once illusions  lies have disappeared. That may be the reason why integrity  honesty are two common traits of the greatest thinkers. You can?t think clearly as long as you?re fooling yourself.</p><p>Too much time is wasted on worrying about how to not ?waste? time.</p><p>?If I had listened to that person at that time ten years ago, I would be nowhere near where I am today.? Most people don?t realize how they keep nurturing toxic relationships. Because they haven?t clearly made the connection between the cause/consequences of many decisions.</p><p>Think about the last time you?ve made a decision based on someone else?s opinion. Could be financial advice. Relationships. Nutrition. How did it go? If you refused to comply to external recommendations, what did you gain from it? Distinguish noise from valuable feedback.</p><p>Also the main reason why spending a daily amount of time ?catching up? with the news is one of the worst activities in terms of ROI of happiness  overall mental health.</p><p>I have witnessed so many cases of people spending a lifetime trying to manipulate others in order to get what they wanted. And also, people who always stayed true to their values  never acted dishonestly, constantly giving  helping genuinely. You can guess who seemed happier.</p><p>Some of my friends from the older generation lost their parents early because of wars or disease/malnutrition. They received no guidance  struggled in their 20s to find their path in an era with no information. Today, most have no excuse if they waste their 20s away.</p><p>Plenty of happily balanced people out there; avoid toxic  mentally unstable people. Don?t underestimate their ability to take you down as they drown. It?s not your responsibility to deal with people?s bullshit.</p><p>People who are burning with anger tend to believe they can extinguish the fire if they communicate their negative energy to others, whereas the simplest (yet difficult) solution is to just smile  let go. Combustion stops when deprived of fuel.</p><p>You will always perceive things with a filter built out of your subjectively fragmented experiences. The only true mistakes? ? Being driven by ego ? Believing that you are not subject to biases  illusions ? Losing your beginner?s mind</p><p>We all think we are open-minded, yet we spend our time putting labels on everything. As soon as you put a label on something, you stop trying to understand it. That?s also the beginning of conflict.</p><p>Depending on your long-term goals and potential returns on investment, it may or may not be worth to compete seriously. As part of a well-balanced lifestyle (including some weight training), it personally helped me find a good pace towards the person I wish to become.</p><p>I was strongly recommended to not get hit at all in the eyes after the Lasik operation I did one year ago and since then, I am being extra careful, with only light sparrings with protections  experienced opponents with a good control (beginners tend to be the most dangerous) ??</p><p><span><a href="https://t.co/rkktd0KLuP">https://t.co/rkktd0KLuP</a></span></p><p>The first step to fight depression is to acknowledge that you are depressed. You can go through a lifetime thinking it?s your natural state. You can believe it?s an ineluctable fate. Or you can fight back. Overcoming depression is in the attempt  the seemingly benign factors.</p><p>Was watching some old photos with my family. You realize how everyone will be forgotten in a few generations. How what seemed incredibly important not so long ago has faded away.  also how breathtaking it is to be able to digitally store  share information across the world.</p><p>Don?t try to reiterate older people?s successes: in most cases, their opportunities are gone, and you live in a different technological era with new ones.  Just surround yourself with those who possess the traits you yearn for.</p><p>The most curious individuals I know easily get bored. They switch from one activity to another with no remorse. But there is one constant when they don?t: when the said activity is reading. You can?t get bored when you have an infinity of minds to explore.</p><p>?In his youth, Albert Einstein spent a year loafing aimlessly.  You dont get anywhere by not wasting time: something, unfortunately, that the parents of teenagers tend frequently to forget.? ? Carlo Rovelli</p><p>Imagine the number of scientific breakthroughs we?ve missed because a potential Einstein died from hunger, disease or war. Or because he grew up in an environment that never allowed him to fulfill his potential. The ideal society will nurture  maximize everyone?s potential.</p><p>Ideals are self-torture:  they are rarely attained, they are always ephemeral, and because your expectations are dynamically evolving, you just end up chasing a succession of illusions  waste precious time.</p><p><span>Imagine re-reading what you wrote a few years ago, and still agree about everything. Witnessing your own stagnation must be nightmarish if you?re being honest with yourself. <a href="https://t.co/ohEj0k1ZS2">https://t.co/ohEj0k1ZS2</a></span></p><p>Talent is intergenerational stored effort. ?Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed.? ? Antoine Lavoisier</p><p>The most common cases: ? People who don?t work out feel insecure when surrounded by smart  fit individuals ? People who have no self-control over their food (sugar everyday) feel uncomfortable around people eating properly Overall, we dislike witnessing our own weaknesses.</p><p>Don?t focus on how people should behave with you. Focus on whether you behave according to your own principles. Self-improvement starts with conscientiousness, yet the very moment we need to be mindful, emotions  instinctive reactions tend to cloud our good judgment.</p><p>The only sustainable relationships are those based on trust,  and they only happen when both sides possess the common core value of honesty. Manipulative people will drain your energy  destroy your principles.</p><p>Mocking others tends to be inversely correlated with self-confidence  self-respect.</p><p>There?s education and Education. The first one is about satisfying our innate desire to learn  cultivating the foundations of authentic curiosity. The second is an illusion based on credentials and status.</p><p>Aside from processed meat, it?s the main component of my diet (mainly chicken + salmon/mackerel). The important part is intermittent fasting imo, which I couldn?t effectively do while my insulin resistance was high: hunger was an issue, hence the switch to low carb).</p><p>A career shouldn?t be a cage: don?t lock yourself up in a false sense of security. Whether you clearly see it or not, there is always a price to pay. Don?t sacrifice freedom  joy for conformity  boredom.</p><p>Modeles of failure are underrated. Take a look at those who never achieved anything  avoid their path. In that category, you have people who only speak up to approve/disapprove everything,  yet never had the courage to take a single initiative nor ever added any value.</p><p>Maybe one day, intermittent fasting and restriction of carbs will be greatly democratized. Everyone will feel lighter, sharper  less depressed. Everyone will be wondering how they could be foolish enough to eat three times a day. I personally wish I had known this sooner.</p><p>Your mind is constantly judging, criticizing  comparing. Yet, as long as thoughts are in the way, you never truly pay attention. Attention is only achieved when focus works in synergy with awareness.</p><p>If no one dislikes you, chances are that no one truly loves you either.</p><p>However insignificant they seem, write down your dreams upon waking up. The connection with the spiritual realm will get increasingly stronger  through daily meditation, you start to notice how inner peace correlates with your understanding of the perception of the reality.</p><p>If you are in a relationship with someone who doesn?t allow you to express yourself honestly, who inhibits your talents, who manipulates aspects of your personality, who spies on your actions, that?s no relationship: that?s prison. Remember you are free to walk away.</p><p>?The better ambitions have to do with the development of character and ability, rather than status and power.  Status you can lose.  You carry character with you wherever you go, and it allows you to prevail against adversity.? ? Jordan B. Peterson</p><p>It?s about balance, but a few questions to ask: ? How much time do I spend with that person  what?s the impact on my life? ? What?s the trade-off in regards to other family members if ties are cut? ? What are the causes? Bad habits? Trauma? Is the person willing to change?</p><p>If you surround yourself with low in energy, moody  overall negative people, don?t be surprised if you can?t find peace in your daily life. Cutting off toxic people is easy once you realize there are plenty of honest, kind  positive people: You just need to make some space.</p><p>Sometimes, you just need to learn to let go of some people. You are not meant to be in their life  they are not meant to be in yours. And its perfectly fine. No need to feel bad about it.  The world is vast enough for anyone to find adequate companions for their own journey.</p><p>Seems like linear thinkers are preponderous in academia.</p><p>Stop asking people what they think about anything. Grow some self-confidence, endure short-term pain, aim for long-term goals, take risks  keep moving forward. Satisfaction comes from being an independent thinker. And the only impartial judge is time.</p><p>Teaching isn?t about transmission of information. Teaching is about transmitting the desire to learn.</p><p>Words are both one of the most lethal weapons  a potential miraculous solution for all our issues. Use them the right way and you can: ? manipulate life itself (DNA) ? create paradigm shifts for mankind (software) ? control people like pawns in a chess game (media/beliefs)</p><p>?A mature person has the integrity to stand alone.  And when a mature person gives love, he or she gives without any strings attached to it. When two mature persons are in love, one of the great paradoxes of life happens: they are together and yet tremendously alone.? ? Osho</p><p>You can always learn something from someone,  but time is a scarce resource,  and not everyone deserves your attention equally. One of the most powerful habits: being able to disregard noise  focus on what provides long-term value.</p><p>?You dont have to add anything in order to be happy; youve got to drop something.  Life?s only hard on your illusions, your ambitions, your greed, your cravings.  Do you know where these things come from? From having identified with all kinds of labels!? ? Anthony de Mello</p><p>Don?t burn the whole forest just because one tree is toxic. Don?t blame an entire group for the misdeeds of the few. Don?t skip the whole book because a few pages are ?boring?. Don?t cower in fear when you fail several times in a row: the chances of success may be independent.</p><p>?Youth is happy because it has the capacity to see beauty.  Anyone who keeps the ability to see beauty never grows old.? ? Franz Kafka</p><p>Don?t blame your parents for your education: you can learn A LOT from incompetent parents. It?s about how you position yourself once independent: a fatalistic victim? a responsible adult?.. and how you take advantage of a blessed digital era where knowledge is no longer scarce.</p><p>Anger is stored insecurity. Compassion is stored kindness.</p><p>Once you realize that getting stuck in the past means you are not moving forward,  once you realize how much you need to unlearn before you can start to learn, being forgetful of superfluous memories becomes a natural decision.</p><p>A forest may be located at the same place for millennia, but most of its trees are being renewed. The cells constituting your body behave similarly throughout your lifetime. Love isn?t immutable either. A relationship is a dynamic process: both sides should and will evolve.</p><p>?Everything thats created comes out of silence.  Your thoughts emerge from the nothingness of silence.  Your words come out of this void. Your very essence emerged from emptiness.  All creativity requires some stillness.? ? Wayne Dyer</p><p>Imagination is one of the most valuable skills,  because as long as you can shift your perspective, you can control your reaction towards the randomness of life, as well as their second  third order effects. Like most skills, it also needs to be nurtured on a regular basis.</p><p>Life is complicated enough as it is: no need to add the challenge of keeping track of all your lies. Yet, that?s what you do when you throw away your integrity  cover innocence and authenticity by layers of self-deception. Full potential is on the path of your bliss.</p><p>Studying and teaching. Reading and applying. Listening and talking. Efficiency tends to thrive upon the complex combination of simple habits.</p><p>?Life is like stepping into a boat which is about to sail out to sea and sink.?</p><p><span>There is no point in reading about what you already apply. <a href="https://t.co/P8jvnf8J5E">https://t.co/P8jvnf8J5E</a></span></p><p>You can?t get respect without kindness; for without kindness, you will inspire fear; and respect out of fear is called authority. Don?t forget it when it comes to relationships.</p><p>On the other hand, frauds seem to quickly multiply in a society where authenticity  integrity are no longer key values. One more reason why depression, anxiety and anger are on the rise: It takes a toll on your mental health to keep track of your lies  tricks.</p><p>The brightest minds I have met don?t waste time embellishing their speeches with fancy words. Straight to the point, concise  adaptively aware of their audience.</p><p>Most people aren?t as busy as they would like to believe: it?s just more comfortable to have an excuse to justify why stagnation has become the norm.</p><p>Anything built out of fear will crumble under its own mass of negative energy  will neither stand the test of time nor be efficient. Examples: Education - fear of bad grades Goals - fear of failing  disappointing yourself Relationships - fear of being alone  not being loved</p><p>?No one gossips about other people?s secret virtues.? ? Bertrand Russell</p><p>When other people?s success make you feel inadequate  insecure, you have two solutions: Use cynicism  ad hominem whilst making excuses for your lack of opportunities OR Take responsibility for your current situation, start making real efforts  grind towards a better life</p><p>Reminds me of people who seemingly had a perfect life: wealthy family, loving  kind parents, good genes (intelligence  attractiveness) but who ended up miserable because of a lack of perspective  gratitude. If your expectations can?t be tempered, you?re in for a tough ride.</p><p>People who make efforts aren?t always rewarded,  but people who were rewarded all went through a ton of efforts. And just because some efforts are not clearly visible doesn?t mean they aren?t the results of decades of compounded good decisions.</p><p>Being in a position where you can afford to solely focus on your ambitions, is a privilege earned by mother Luck, who granted you life at a certain time  place of History. You don?t owe anyone anything, but expressing your gratitude with kindness tend to lead to inner Peace.</p><p>Teach through actions, not words. ?If there is anything that we wish to change in the child,  we should first examine it and see whether it is not something that could better be changed in ourselves.? ? Carl Jung</p><p>The best relationships are effortless from the beginning. Don?t waste your time  energy building on crumbling foundations. Our society today is full of opportunities, each one leading to a completely different life. Just make sure you became someone worth having around first.</p><p>Irritation arises when reality  subjective ideals don?t match. The sheer number of external factors make it impossible to control reality. On the other hand, ideals can be completely reshaped depending on what you feed your body  your mind. Small habits lead to big changes.</p><p>Most people aren?t trying to help. They want to impose their point of view. Why do you care if MY food is ?bland?  not full of sugar/salt? Why do you care if money isn?t MY priority? Why do you care if prestige, status  power are meaningless to ME? My life, my decisions.</p><p>Anger is fear spilling out.</p><p>In a society where the standards have been slowly decreasing, where consistent physical  mental efforts are becoming uncommon, where self-control  mindfulness are considered exceptional, ?different?, ?weird? or ?unusual? are great compliments to be told.</p><p>?The secret of genius is to carry the spirit of the child into old age, which means never losing your enthusiasm.? ? Aldous Huxley</p><p>A tweet is an advice you give yourself. An additional step towards becoming the person you wish to become. Floating concepts  ideas are only truly mastered once you can express them in a concise  clear manner.</p><p>We all have different definitions of the word ?effort?.

And you don?t want to end up jealous, insecure  full of regrets.</p><p>Thanks everyone for your thoughts! ?? Thinking about it, such people tend to be rare, because when you ?possess a warmful aura, an honest smile  are overall positive  happy?, You tend to attract a lot of people in your life, including potential partners.</p><p>Overall, how did your view about money change throughout your 20s and 30s? Were there any particular triggers for some shifts of perspective?</p><p>??</p><p>Does anyone know ?old? people (60+), who spent most of their lives alone with no husband/wife/children, yet possess a warmful aura, an honest smile  who are overall positive  happy people? If so, what do you think support them in their journey of life?</p><p>Success is a result of failing properly.</p><p>A non negligible number of teachers don?t understand their subject. The education system has plenty of issues, but the fact that the supposedly enlightened guides are not qualified enough is certainly a core reason. Education is about learning how to think independently.</p><p>Lacking of mindfulness is similar to possessing a leaking fountain: when you are finally thirsty, there?s no more water to be drunk. Mindful people efficiently store their energy  fulfill their potential whenever the needs arise.</p><p>Living in anticipation of ?retirement?, a concept implying that the first three quarters of your life aren?t as enjoyable as the last quarter, might not be the wisest course of action anyway.</p><p>There is so much to be unlearnt before you can start to learn.</p><p>You also only need to succeed once. And as long as you haven?t painted a masterpiece yet, you have nothing to lose: you can try and fail again and again. In most cases, what people are afraid to lose is much less valuable than they think.</p><p>Most of our issues come from the inability to distinguish what we want from what we need: Unhealthy food Toxic relationships Bad habits Impulsive reactions Modern self-brainwashing We only realize something is wrong in hindsight.</p><p>And if you?re offended when you?re around optimism, positivity  kindness, It?s because you?re already bleeding inside, And it?s leaking to your external reactions. Help yourself first: heal yourself.</p><p>Most people have no idea what they are talented at, because they are too busy looking at others. Most also don?t realize how bad they are at what they are doing, because they are corrupted by the voice of ego. Play the game that favors your strengths, not your weaknesses.</p><p>Common traits of successful people: ? wise allocation of time, privileging long-term over short-term goals ? an emphasis on the basics, with a healthy dose of humility ? a circle of trusted friends  meaningful relationships ? an optimistic  yet disciplined mind</p><p>?We humans have lost the wisdom of genuinely resting and relaxing.  We worry too much.  We dont allow our bodies to heal, and we dont allow our minds and hearts to heal.? ? Thich Nhat Hanh</p><p>Uneducated people always resort to ad hominem based on labels in their attempts to discredit what they dislike.

Your global ranking keeps improving as long as you don?t give up.</p><p>?We are afraid of living, afraid of losing a job, afraid of tradition, afraid of what the neighbours, or what the wife or husband would say, afraid of death.

Meeting people can change your life. Whether you can benefit from these opportunities depends on your: ? open-mindedness ? eagerness to learn ? imagination Never get stuck to a unidimensional perspective.</p><p>It?s scary to be alone in the wild, because you finally have to face your thoughts, take responsibility for all your actions, and stop blaming  finding scapegoats through narrative fallacies.</p><p>You can?t make a difference in anyone?s life if you haven?t made a difference in yours. ?I wanna help people? often comes from people who lack a sense of purpose, and who would rather be ?busy? than face that reality. Helping others is a consequence:  it starts with oneself.</p><p>Life is a game where the winners are those who fully take advantage of the power of compound interest: it?s about minimizing the number of interruptions of efforts, while constantly increasing the levels of energy allocated to daily habits.</p><p>Exceptional people will never claim nor believe they are exceptional. That?s how they achieved their current circumstances: Through humility, self-drive  self-focus. They leave aside comparisons with others, ignore social signaling  remain disciplined without making excuses.</p><p>The healthy man does not torture others - generally it is the tortured who turn into torturers. ?

Chomsky</p><p>Whenever you?re about to do something, ask yourself: ?Long-term, if I repeat this behavior for months or years, what will I get??

There is so much to learn even from bad parenthood. It?s all about how you interpret what you see, and how you decide to take initiatives. If not for them, you wouldn?t even be there pondering such questions anyway.</p><p>?Where there is love, there are no demands, no expectations, no dependency.  I do not demand that you make me happy; my happiness does not lie in you.  If you were to leave me, I will not feel sorry for myself; I enjoy your company immensely, but I do not cling.? ? A.

Successful people don?t spend the majority of their time  energy picturing their doom: Despite objectively ?seeing? the possibility of failure they gather their strength  work towards the desired goals. With discipline  heart.</p><p>Opportunity cost and compound interest should mandatorily be well understood by everyone in the context of life. Habits, relationships, mindset. Physical, mental  spiritual health. They all stem from both notions, which dictate the plot of your story.</p><p>As long as you are afraid of being alone, as long as you avoid loneliness out of fear, as long as you are unable to embrace silence, clarifying your thoughts  emptying your mind from superfluous reactions will be impossible. Discipline starts with self-focus.</p><p>Yep, one meal a day.

Hence why focusing on becoming the best version of yourself is so important. Healthy relationships are a consequence of a healthy lifestyle: many wrongly believe that being in couple solves everything.</p><p>If you properly spent time on Twitter, you realized how most people around you in real life have no idea about the benefits of: ? fasting ? reading books ? being mindful ? good habits, including thoughts habits  weight training ? cutting down on carbs ? stopping gossips</p><p>Anger is a contract preventing any form of happiness  peace, that you voluntarily sign with yourself, because you forgot you had the possibility to walk away without reacting emotionally. Hence the importance of learning from mistakes  being mindful.</p><p>Criticizing others is a good way to divert yourself into thinking that you?re doing something valuable. That?s the new procrastination. And that?s why it has become so popular, overtaking value creation.</p><p>Most people don?t truly listen to you, they just listen to their own interpretation of your words the way they want to hear it, and pretend to understand them.</p><p>If you never witness acts of kindness around you, you are either around the wrong people, or you are the wrong person.</p><p>Don?t hang around people who mismatch their words  their actions: You will end up the same, with inconsistencies all over your life, with no awareness of how dishonest you have been behaving with the gift of life you received. That?s the cause of many fears, worries  stress.</p><p>Every single conversation is an opportunity to improve yourself, but few put their attention on the right place: whenever you feel an emotional surge, whenever you feel irritated, whenever you react, Ask yourself: why? Is it because of insecurities I refuse to face?</p><p>A poor mindset consists of blaming people around you. With such a stance, you end up financially, physically, mentally  spiritually poor. If you think it?s never your fault, you spend your time looking for an invisible culprit. That?s how a toxic person behaves: avoid them.</p><p>Things don?t happen suddenly in life. The ?stable state? slowly stores efforts  pressure increases. Nothing is visible for years. But one day, everything is released at once  become visible: Diseases, insecurities, anger  sorrow. But also health, serenity  intelligence.</p><p>The act of forcefully trying to avoid suffering itself is one cause of suffering. Peace comes from acceptance,  but it will never be easy, however low you keep your expectations, because there will always be something that you refuse to lose.</p><p>Insight comes from struggles. You can?t envy someone?s success and simultaneously put aside the pain it took to get there. Yet, that?s often how most of us react by default.</p><p>If, upon reading this, you thought, ?Funny how the word ?sick? is often negatively connotated  kind of judgmental? without catching yourself on this random thought, that?s exactly the mindfulness I am referring to. Mindfulness in your daily life takes a lot of practice.</p><p>If you spend your time around people who constantly judge  react, don?t be surprised to ride the same emotional rollercoaster daily. You are what you absorb, compounded through time. Food, people, books, places, experiences: the whole world is your teacher.</p><p>If you ever feel ashamed of your thoughts, just put yourself in a position where those don?t even cross your mind anymore. Whether they are based on envy, anger or fear, remember: you nurtured them  allowed them to grow unhealthily; but you can also let them fade away  die.</p><p>Being great at communication requires imagination: if you can?t emphasize with your audience, if you aren?t able to listen to people  understand the non-obvious, you won?t be able to convey the words they expect to hear.</p><p><span>People who don?t grow can?t imagine what growing feels like; they are lost in a comforting dishonest self-talk, yet, are often the first ones to arrogantly  wrongly believe that they have the required open-mindedness  empathy to understand others. <a href="https://t.co/lbEjtlzGsw">https://t.co/lbEjtlzGsw</a></span></p><p>The same food will not taste identically when healthy  when sick. The same water will not be as refreshing in winter and in summer. People won?t look the same when you?re happy  when you?re unhappy. That?s what it means to perceive the world subjectively.</p><p>We shouldn?t fool ourselves into believing that being ?busy with responsibilities? is the reason why we aren?t satisfied with our life. Those reading this tweet are already amongst a minority of privileged who had access to a broad education. We might just lack gratitude.</p><p>Happy people are repelled by unhappy people. If you seem to be mostly surrounded by unhappy people, it may be time to objectively reconsider the way you act, which led to the way you are perceived by other people.</p><p>Don?t use transparency/honesty as an excuse to attack people.</p><p>In hindsight, the answer always seems obvious. But I used to wake up on an alarm clock. Neglecting weight training. Eating bread/pasta/rice/pizza/noodles everyday. Spending hours on YT/Netflix. Surrounding myself with toxic people. And neglecting the worthy ones.</p><p>It?s easier to find a scapegoat than to blame yourself for poor judgment  bad decisions. You are responsible for your own mindset today. You choose what to feed your body  your mind. You choose to meet or not to meet such  such people. And you choose your daily priorities.</p><p>?Schools serve the same social functions as prisons and mental institutions:  to define, classify, control, and regulate people.? ? Michel Foucault</p><p>The most interesting people arent trying to be interesting. They just live an interesting life.</p><p>From my personal experience, the causes of depression and parasitic thoughts, in order of importance: 1) Lack of sleep, 2) Lack of muscles, 3) Sugar, 4) Too much noise: a) Gossips b) News / social media / movies, 5) Lack of trust-based relationships, 6) Financial stress</p><p>Irrational decisions stem from fear. Fear finds its roots in ignorance. And today, ignorance is a choice.</p><p>Most of your suffering comes from being unable to distinguish what you want from what you need. As long as you don?t understand yourself, as long as your thoughts and your emotions are intermingled with fear and desires, pain will never fade away.</p><p>Once we have found ?what? to do, it?s easy to become complacent and not focus on ?how? to do it. It?s like a baby who is finally able to stand up: It?s now time to learn how to walk, how to run, how to jump, and finally, how to do all of them better.</p><p>Men are born ignorant, not stupid. They are made stupid by education. To conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom. Science is what you know, philosophy is what you dont know. The secret to happiness is to face the fact that the world is horrible. ? Bertrand Russell</p><p>You are not a job, a nationality, a preference, or a number. Don?t start describing yourself with words  labels. That?s the best way to fool yourself into believing what you are not: The way you see yourself will determine all your actions. Hence, you want to see clearly.</p><p>The culmination is found in indifference.</p><p>You only get hurt if there?s a part of truth in what you?ve heard. Irritation is an indicator: You are not satisfied with the person you are today. It?s up to you to change, through concrete actions, good habits  the discipline to stick to your principles.</p><p>Don?t ask yourself why someone?s words hurt you, that?s covering leaks (emotions) with tape (thoughts): it may help short-term; but a specific solution doesn?t work on a general problem. Instead: feel, understand  put yourself in a position where you no longer get hurt.</p><p>There is always a trade-off. Make sure you don?t exchange what is precious  scarce against what can be found in unlimited amounts: Find the right balance when it comes to time and money.</p><p>One decision can change your life. One book can change your life. One conversation can change your life. One relationship can change your life. Whether it changes your life positively or negatively depends on good judgment. And good judgment is acquired.</p><p>?No one would talk much in society if they knew how often they misunderstood others.? ? Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</p><p>Not getting your curiosity repressed by school is a privilege. Those who had the opportunity to grow up in such blessed environments tend to forget it. Those who weren?t that lucky tend to use their circumstances as an excuse to not start growing.</p><p>Many spend way too much time contemplating what they should do right,  and nearly not enough on what they shouldn?t do wrong.</p><p>Most people aren?t listening to you. They are listening to their own voice, corrupted by a set of subjective beliefs  a confused aggregation of their memories of you.</p><p>Long-term, you get exactly the relationships you deserve. Similarly to financial investments, it all depends on who you invest your time on  whether you are patient enough to collect the rewards.</p><p>People underestimate to what extent the lack of money is inhibiting all their intellectual capabilities. The opportunity cost of the time  energy spent on worrying about basic expenditures is huge. Especially if it?s being compounded through several decades.</p><p>Never underestimate how damageful to the human mind lack of purpose can be.</p><p>Remember these kids who due to deep insecurities stemming from a lack of love from their parents ended up bullying other kids in an attempt to compensate for an imbalanced emotional state? They grew up to become fully-fledge adults too but not everyone evolves in the process.</p><p>Well said.

Peterson</p><p>?You feel good, you feel bad, and these feelings are bubbling from your own unconsciousness, from your own past.  Nobody is responsible except you. Nobody can make you angry, and nobody can make you happy.? ? Osho</p><p>The reason why you should build your relationships based on values: you would be surprised by how differently some people perceive their existence. Many people are completely blinded by labels: I am national  Dont waste time on pointless conflicts.</p><p>Take a look at School: See how little time kids have to think, by and for themselves? Instead of learning to become independent thinkers, they are constantly being taught ?the right way? to live. We have a long way to go before we fully take advantage of the digital tools.</p><p>In order to understand someone, ask them what they value most. Time? Money? Status? Family? ... There?s no such thing as an ?intrinsic best way to live your life?; but being surrounded by people with values opposed to yours is a good recipe for pointless conflicts.</p><p>If you don?t do it today, what makes you think you would do it tomorrow? Probably the illusion of control over your actions. We are habit-based machines with a glimpse of the source code, which we attempt to understand through trial  error whilst blindfolded.</p><p>Whether you get hurt or not by words depends on your brain. Words are harmless sound waves. But we are responsible for how we interpret them.</p><p>Something that seems to be overlooked when it comes to education: Leading kids to discover the value of effort. Once they have experienced its gratifying feeling, they will refuse to live a stagnant life.</p><p>Being reminded of your own flaws leads to discomfort. Typically, insecure people can?t bear the sight of self-confident people. For them, self-confidence is always equal to arrogance. Noticing any surge of discomfort is an opportunity to become the person you want to become.</p><p>Peace will never be found as long as you still expect people to behave according to your subjective ideals.</p><p>A clear mind  a good judgment when it comes to what you truly need, is the greatest asset you can acquire to face the 21st century: Beliefs, deceptions, facts  unsolved mysteries: everything seems intertwined, and the constant input of data clouds even the brightest minds.</p><p>Most people build their identity out subjective beliefs, and that?s already the beginning of conflict. You don?t need to justify any of your decisions out of the fear of ?disappointing? anyone, really. ??</p><p>When my dad offered me a comic book when I was 6,  he neither expected me to fall in love with reading, not that it would translate into my daily social interactions, leading to a treasure of opportunities. The power of compound interest works best through several decades.</p><p>Think about seemingly insignificant actions that you?ve done which tremendously compounded through the years. An encounter.

It?s all about causality: there?s no miracle.</p><p>Yep that?s a daily routine. :) I remain flexible when it comes to special occasions / social events, but I?ve noticed how the more satisfied I was with my body/mind, along with some healthy  deep relationships, and the easier it was to simply say ?no? to various invitations.</p><p>Don?t listen to advice from someone who hasn?t ?made it? yet. Financial advice? Listen to wealthy people. Health-related? Pay attention to their body (skin, energy levels, fitness..) Life wisdom? Learn from those who had skin in the game, failed  learnt from their mistakes.</p><p>In hindsight, people have regrets when they think about the risks they haven?t taken  the missed opportunities, yet they rarely think about the mistakes they?ve avoided because of their very mishap. Failing small can be a path to not fail bigger. Start defining ?failure?.</p><p>Even if the whole Bitcoin / crypto experiment ends up failing, you can?t deny its impact in terms of education about finance  money. That?s your ?killer app?.

Unlearning all of it. Once false beliefs  bad habits are deeply ingrained in an emotionally charged mixture, trying to distinguish the individual flavors will require an exceptional palate.</p><p>The way we are trying to fight diabete  obesity with medication, is like simultaneously drilling and putting cement in a well, without realizing that the wells, us, are pointlessly being damaged, and that the only winners are cement manufacturers  drilling companies.</p><p>We refuse to listen, yet we expect to understand. Refusal to listen to others. Refusal to listen to our own body and all the signals it desperately sends. Refusal to step back  observe our own mind. That?s when most conflicts emerge, at all levels  from all perspectives.</p><p>It?s easier to avoid the real questions when you?ve surrounded yourself with problems not based on an objective reality, but on your desires. It?s like building a castle out of thoughts, getting lost inside during your whole life  pretend that the outer world doesn?t exist.</p><p>I guess there?s no ?secret recipe?, considering the starting point  the background of each one of us is different. Starting a new life in a country where you neither know the language nor the culture may be a good idea for example. :-)</p><p>The reason why some of the greatest scientists and thinkers are also incredibly talented pedagogues, for example Richard Feynman, is because learning and teaching work in synergy and can?t be dissociated.

The power of compound interest will exacerbate all the small deviations from childhood to adulthood: Kids surrounded by diversified books and insights will develop their imagination  desire to learn.</p><p>1/5 Being able to change your perspective is a skill that few unlock.

When your actions are aligned with your thoughts, you accumulate self-confidence, self-respect  satisfaction. When they are not, you end up swimming in a pool of regrets.</p><p>Remember before you started your first serious relationship? You kept worrying about how to act cool which ruined your authenticity.

Value is also subjective  depends on shared beliefs.

Both physically  cognitively.</p><p>If you aren?t self-confident enough to ask someone out, it?s time to work on yourself first. Contrary to what many seem to believe, being in a relationship won?t naturally improve your life.

Learning a language should be complementary to an already balanced lifestyle, not a goal. The return on investment isn?t that high, unless you start selling ?how I became fluent in 3 months? books.</p><p>On the other hand, if you?re studying a language whose grammar is totally different, it will take time for your brain to rewire itself properly.

How you act hidden behind a computer screen exposes your position towards self-respect. Changing habits is hard. Authenticity can be your greatest weapon. Or your demise, depending on your quintessence.</p><p>4) Words dont hurt unless you give them meaning  let them hurt you. Words are just data captured by your body sensors. is well aware of that: The irrationality of some bullies is astounding: you waste both YOUR time  someone elses, yet complain about being blocked?</p><p>3) As an adult with a functioning brain, you have free will  theres no point for people to tell you what you should or shouldnt do.

It should be an opportunity to provide a sustainable fix to a major problem in your life, yet many lack the awareness required to even notice that its a problem because theyve grown used to it.</p><p>They dont realize how the more they try to fight against the tide, the more painful every step of their life journey becomes.

Yet, bliss can only be found in either total ignorance or deep understanding.</p><p>Old people who are full of regrets are quickly getting carried away by the storm of their emotions when what they tried to bury seem to be resurfacing. I dont want talk about it! isnt a legitimate excuse when it = how do I fully enjoy the remaining time I have left?</p><p>Being able to listen to yourself objectively is necessary in order to master a foreign language. If you try to avoid the fact that you sound awkward/weird/unnatural, you wont improve your pronunciation. Its all about ego  self-acceptance. Again.</p><p>Authenticity seeks authenticity.

Parsimony is the key.</p><p>Beliefs are necessary up to a certain point: You are popping into existence at a random time  a random place, And your mind needs an anchor in order for the emotional storm stirring your mind to calm down.</p></div></div></div></div>
