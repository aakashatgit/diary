It was the heavy weight dream team of 3 ex Goldman bankers. And me!</p><p>The teams head was Marc Cheval (might be spelled wrong, cant seem to find him on Google).</p><p>Anyway, Marc was once giving me a lift on his way back home in his flashy sports car, and said, “Look, Asim, a lot of people say they will learn French, or lose weight, or they will read some book.”</p><p>“The difference between most other people and me is that I dont do them tomorrow, I actually do them. Today.”</p><p>He explained, “Im tired right now, but I dont care. Im going to drop you off, get home, and I will read at least a couple of chapters of [some finance book I cant recall]. I dont care how tired I am. I am going to get through a couple of chapters. Because I dont do things tomorrow. I do them today.”</p></div></div></div></div>
