Was it same with other subjects? No, therefore practice diligently and continuously(I practiced Accounts almost everyday with the <!-- -->4<!-- -->Subjects in <!-- -->1 <!-- -->day schedule, however time allotted was almost majorly to accounts as compared to others.)</li></ol><ol><li>You have to dive as deeply as possible into your goals. I searched and compiled all available resources for IPCC, joined numerous whatsapp<!-- -->/telegram groups for daily updation-interaction, same goes for all your life goals(Be serious enough so that you leave no stone unturned, i went through all ICAI Supplementary material, official notices, amendment notes, etc.)</li><li>Dont excuse yourself with “First step towards success is Failure”, you should strike your goal at the first shot itself, thats efficiency. If you want to reach the top you need to increase your efficiency and productivity(doing more in less time). For this you need to be “Proactive” like Aman Chitkara(street-smart).</li></ol><p>    
    Push yourself and be so confident and committed that youre able to commit to yourself or others that no matter what youll achieve the goal. For this you gotta be willing to sacrifice and focused on it entirely. You should be so worthy due to your practice, hardwork, diligence, willpower that you knock off the target with one shot at the very first attempt. “You do or do not, theres no try”</p><ol><li>Focus entirely on your “true goal” adjusted for priorities.</li><li>Fight till the end, no matter what<!-- -->! <!-- -->Fight to win and not lose small.</li><li>Dont think of losing, failing, taking it as an excuse for winning “eventually”. Win at the straight shot.</li><li>Be able enough to commit to yourself that youll achieve no matter what, so that youre confident enough and <strong>losing is not an option.</strong></li><li>You think of having an option to lose and think of it as an escape way to further “learn from experience” or “first step towards success is failure” but dont let this philosophy hammer your ability to reach you true potential.</li><li>You gotta achieve something you should at the very first shot.</li><li>Learn to take risks and commitment(“I will achieve this goal no matter what”). You should be able to challenge people with your commitment towards your goal and not be doubtful about achieving it.</li></ol></div></div></div></div>
