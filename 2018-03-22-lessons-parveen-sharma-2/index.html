Perform actions as per priorities. Use baniya mindset to get most out of limited time. For instance if you have to study for IPCC alongwith college, manage it, use free time(Metro, early morning, etc.). You must learn to manage yourself, its a skill that takes time to master it. Start right now to master it.</p></div></div></div></div>
