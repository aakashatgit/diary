She was selling <em>Yakult Milk, a probiotic drink. I had no intention of buying and i politely declined her offer.</em></p><p>As she walked by to the adjacent house with her brute-force approach to sell the product it came to my mind:</p><blockquote><em>why dont they target consumers based upon their buying history?</em></blockquote><p>A supermart is around 50 metres from my residence where same product is kept on the shelf for years and yet here she is trying to ring every neighbor in the colony. Why cant they simply buy the <em>dataset from the supermart</em> with which they could find people who might buy the product, saving enormous costs of selling it and more importantly time of employees.</p><p>The problem is <em>“CASH Transactions”.</em></p><p>Cash transactions have no way of linking the identity of buyer with the transaction, its anonymous. But nowadays we do have various platforms, budding services include PayTM, FreeCharge, and other payment services.</p><p>Guess what? They do maintain records of every person making payment to whosoever for whatsoever.</p><p>You pay for a beverage in a supermarket through such payment services and you got yourself enlisted in their <strong><em>dataset</em></strong> along with the item you bought with respective <em><strong>transaction ID</strong></em>.</p><p>Now payment service, say PayTM, has all transactions <em>mapped</em> to TRANSACTION IDs, and the supermarket has mapped the sale of their products with the above TRANSACTION IDs.</p><p>All we need is to get these datasets from both the entities, i.e. the Supermarket and Payment Service, and with machine learning can easily find <em>“Potential Buyers”</em> for our product. Finally we can approach them either personally or virtually. All done by not our salesgirls but outside entities. Time and redundant efforts saved!</p><p>I think that is a potential opportunity and untapped market for the emerging payment services as well as ecommerce platforms- <em>to sell data for targeted marketing strategies.</em></p></div></div></div></div>
