Shout at him, and he is almost compelled to shout back. Act calmly and unemotionally, and you turn away his anger before it gets started.</li><li>Act enthusiastic and you arouse the enthusiasm of the other person.</li></ul><p>Human relations often become deadlocked because each party is afraid to make the first move.</p><p>Don’t wait for a sign from the other fellow. Assume that he is going to be friendly, and act accordingly.</p><p>Assume the attitude that you wish the other person to take. Act as if you expected him to like you.</p><p>Take a chance that the other fellow will be friendly. It is always a gamble, but you’ll win 99 times for every time you lose, if you’ll just bet on his being friendly. Refuse to take the chance, and you’ll lose every time.
Just relax and take for granted that other people do like you.
Use the magic of your smile to warm up the other fellow.</p></div></div></div></div>
