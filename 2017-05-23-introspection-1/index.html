And I started complaining about things that wasnt in my hands and how how his ideas imposed on me led to be this failure.</p><p>But the real question was were these reasons actually genuine, and the answer is of course not it was me all the time I had been indiscipline. And yet when he inquired about it i got angry, why? Because deep down i knew the reasons i told him are bullshit. Unable to get that regret out led to me anger.</p><p>Whenever you want true advice, talk to your heart. It may know what your mind may not be willing to tell you. I think the heart here nothing but that part of brain which is rational, which tells you the truth no matter how harsh it is.</p><p>There was lack of practice. Practice isnt reading and recollecting, its writing down, so that your mind questions it everytime and everything. White writing you make neutral connections more stronger, leading to much more understanding. By writing down you get are of things that you may overlook white reading.</p><p>Ofcourse theres a trade off, and its time here. Investment in <em>time</em> and <em>effort</em> is huge here and thats why we tend to deviate to much easier methods like reading it.</p><p>Another thing i learnt was whatever you do, no matter how insignificant it is, give your best, do it <em>wholeheartedly.</em></p><em>Immerse yourself completely.</em><p>You have to do it either way, why not do it with all your potential.</p></div></div></div></div>
